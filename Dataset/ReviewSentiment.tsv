This is my second pair and I have nothing but good things to say!  Comfortable, good bass depth and very durable. Volume control is a huge plus, especially in the workshop which is where I am most of the time.	1
Listening to music through these headphones is like listening to music through a blanket.  Everything sounds muted, the highs don't extend very far, the lows are almost non existent.  Their sound is anything but clear.  Dynamics?  Forget about itI'm looking for a $20ish pair of headphones to keep in my backpack at all times.  I figured these might do the job...but wow was I wrong.I found the Sony MDR-XD100, which is actually cheaper, sound much better.  Did I mention the build quality sucks?  The XD100s are a little more durable but still leave much to be desired.  Perhaps that's just low end Sonys in general?I'm thinking about just dropping the extra few bucks for a pair of Sennheiser PX100s or AKG K81DJs.My main headphones are the Grado SR-80 and BeyerDynamic DT990s...I know what good sounds like.  All my music is either FLAC or 192 Kbps VBR mp3s.I'm giving these headphones a two star because I've heard worse...and much better for cheaper.	0

Item arrived quickly and in great condition.  I am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near future.	1
Perhaps I'm just used to real studio headphones, but these don't even sound as good as my in ear monitors.  I'd like to give them a break for only being $20, but considering the fact that these are practically unusable without a high boost and mid cut EQ, it's hard to justify the purchase.  I just do not know why these lack so much high end and boost the 250-500k frequencies so much.  After cutting these frequencies in iTunes, they don't sound bad, but you shouldn't have to run an EQ to get a decent sound.  Only thing I like about these is the inline volume control.Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on a higher end model.  You'll be happy you did.	0

I have the MDR-150's and these have the exact same sound quality. I have bought several different brands in various price ranges (all the way up to $100), and these are the best bang for the buck. I don't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesn't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced. The only problem with these Sony's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears. Would buy these again if they last a few years.	1
This is a nice unit, and it is interesting to read the glowing reviews of customers who have owned the Garmin eMap for two or three weeks. I have owned the unit for over a year. It works well in the US. It will not guide you street by street to a location, but it will guide you &quot;as the crow flys.&quot; You get a straight line between you and the destination. It works.It does not work well in Europe. I purchased the UK and French CDs. I installed them on the memory card and used them in England, Wales, and all over France. The first problem is that the Garmin eMap just doesn't pick up or hold on to the GPS satellites in Europe very well. It may be that they are too far south or that the antenna is designed for use in US latitudes. I have no explanation but if you intend to use this in Europe, look for another unit.The second problem is that even after loading the UK and French MetroGuides, when you press the Find button you get a list of US cities. I disabled the US city maps and I still got the list of US cities. You cannot &quot;Find&quot; and navigate to a foreign city. The only way to navigate is to know where the city is, then scroll to it on the tiny eMap screen and click on it. If you don't know where the city or tiny Welsh village is, then you are completely out of luck. Very frustrating either way. Again, if you are travelling out of the US you should steer clear of the eMap.My other problem is with Garmin's service. I could not get my eMap to communicate with my laptop. It communicated with three different workstations, but not my Dell laptop. Garmin tech support insisted that there was obviously something wrong with my laptop. I even read them the error messages from the MapSource program, which cited program line numbers with errors in them. They insisted that the problem was my laptop, not their software. I own my own software company, so I know a software problem from a hardward problem. My modem and PalmPilot work on the laptop but the Garmin does not. Garmin's support staff refused to help or even acknowledge that there was a problem. They refused to bring the problem up with a senior support person or a programmer. I got the same answer no matter how many times I called and no matter who I spoke with. A year went by and I got along by using a workstation. Recently Garmin made an update available for their MapSource program that fixed a communications bug with some laptops. I downloaded it and magically my laptop started communicating with the eMap.If you never need customer support, and you won't travel out of the US, then the eMap is a product you should seriously consider.	0

For the price the best.  I have 3 pair of these headphones for all my various listening locations?  The volume control works great and very convenient .	1
I bought this mouse to use with my laptop, which only has one PS/2 port, and I'm using that for an external keyboard.  So I needed a USB mouse, and figured that Microsoft's optical mouse would be a good choice.  Wrong!  Windows 98 had no trouble recognizing the hardware, and the software installed fine, but with the correct driver installed, the mouse's movement was totally erratic.  Just to be clear, I already have a Logitech cordless optical mouse on my desktop PC, so this was not a question of getting used to an optical mouse.  The Microsoft mouse simply refused to work properly, on all types of surfaces.  After 20 minutes of trying very hard to adjust the speed and get the thing to go where I wanted it to go, I gave up.  I should have paid attention to the reviewers here who warned about the poor quality of this product.  I'm returning it to Best Buy tomorrow.	0

These are the only headphones I use now. I have been so pleased with them that whenever I want a pair I simply go to my previous purchase, click on the link, add them to the cart, and as if by magic, they appear at my doorstep in two days. I use a set at work, a set on the boat, a set for the stereo, a set for the music gear, etc, etc. Love these headphones.	1
I bought this 650+ with a D Link AirPlus 614+, also supports 22 Mbps. Upon installing the software and rebooting the card came up ok for the first few time. Then it was not recognized by the computer and wanted to reinstall the drivers. Plus, the card did not let me connect to other computers on the network to transfer files. The card has been intermittent and pain. Very bad product or just this set of router and pc card. Do not recomend this line of products. The hub DHCP server died in less than six months. Several techs tried to install and setup and on several Dell laptops. Tried a Linksys USB card and it work great. So think again about purchasing this product.	0

Was just listening to Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor with these phones.I'd say they reproduced the recording pretty damn well!Not excessively bright and just right in the minor classical music phrases.The phones are plugged into an Onkyo TX8211 (one of Onkyo's rock bottom receiversas I type this) at 3\5th's volume.Also been using these with a notebook and a couple of portable players.They aren't difficult for the lower audio output (battery powered) devices to drive.Happy to know these work very well with a mobile phone for listening to music.I have a hard time with the ear-buds for extended periods, they driveme nuts...I try to rate audio stuff based on what is being reproduced.A preference for listening has always been the best recordings I can afford.At times streaming music and other processed audio will be such a disappointmenteven from the best audio gear.Spent more than a few bucks on Beyers, AKG's and Sennheisers over the yearsall of which we could pay homage to, yet those don't matter here in this review.I think Sony does a good job of designing and making audio things in general.No complaining here...Rating the MDR-250V headphones a great buy in the $20-$30 range.If you own these I'm hoping you enjoy them as I have been doing...	1
I used this card for one year in the library of my university - and I always had problems obtaining a stable connection. I thought it was because of the signal. Then I used other friend's laptop there - one with a Netgear card, one IBM T41 with built-in wireless, geez, they all worked so well. So, the conclusion is: this D-Link just sucks! I am dumping mine and getting a new one.Don't buy D-Link. Never.	0

I use these headphones with my Avid mbox mini and since I have set everything up I have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better.  They are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint.  My wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasons.	1
This uses a TI chipset which TI refuses to release any information about to the Linux driver writers. Thus it is unlikely to ever be  Linux compatible. It seems to work okay under Windows XP, but I try not to support jerks and you can get a much faster Wireless-G card for not much more nowdays, so it's definitely *not* recommended.	0

These headphones are great at this price! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume. My only complaint is that there's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours! Overall, the sound is great and very well balanced!	1
I have made 2 separate attempts of trying D-Link's wireless cards and both times they failed miserably.  This setup isn't worth the hassle.  The connection is terrible, setup is a nightmare, and there are better products on the market ...Good luck to you with this piece o' mess.	0

Excellent price and service.  I like the volume control onin the cabel, comeswith two size input jacks.  2 Meter cabel is just fine for PC Use which I purchased it for.  Excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor again.	1
I noticed no difference with this card as oppose to Linksys or Netgear 11Mbps wireless card.	0

I got mine in nov 2002 and i have used them primarily at work, which is sitting in front of a workstation for about 8-9 hours a day.most reviews have been very accurate. these are a bit tight even if you have an avg sized head. after about an hour of listening your ears do pain. i just got used to them and probly they have slackened up over time.but they are even more painful if you wear spectacles.also the cushion is pretty cheap and really not very helpful.the sound is decent. from my experience AVOID ANY HEADPHONES that have a volume controller since this is the weakest link in the chain. my headphones having finally given up at exactly this point. all in all they served me pretty well for 2.5 yrshope they made some changes to the model...	1
WARNING: DWL-650+ may corrupt firmware on HP laptops.  The DWL-650+ software would not install on my target HP Omnibook, so I tried it on my newest HP Omnibook, which already had built-in wireless.  Performance review: the DWL-650+ worked irratically.  After I uninstalled the D-Link software, my laptop's internal wireless was no longer functioned.  I am a SW/HW engineer, and after 20 hours of work and calls to D-Link support, I believe that the laptop's original wireless firmware has been corrupted beyond repair -- a sickning price to pay.  For me, nightime D-Link support was helpful; daytime support struck me as ignorant and rude.  Their email response to my request for escallation: "Dear: Valued Customer ...

These Sony headphones are a great option for the price range. The ear cups are very comfortable, even when wearing for long time periods, and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses. These were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit, and he says it works well for that. I've used them in-flight to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then, as well.Other reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control, but I have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since 2009, I believe. I enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie (or the boyfriend's practice session), and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too short.There is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones, but don't expect anything excellent in that department. With heavy music going you'll know someone is speaking to you, but will not know from which direction or what the person is saying.I do feel that the audio quality is poorer than you'd get with a much higher priced headphone setup, but for this price and intended use, I cannot find any reason to not give these 5 stars.	1
Tech support could not help, switching laptops did nothing. A replacement DWL-650+ showed the same symptoms. I then decided to buy a cheap wireless VCNET 22mbps card (9.95$) and it has never ever lost the connection to the router, the signal is consistently stronger (now I can use it in the back yard where as the D-Link) would drop to a red connection and within seconds lose the connect entirely.Just a waste of money, go with a no name brand, they work fine. The D-Link router (DI-641+ or better) does perform brilliantly though.	0

These are great headphones for the money. I have a home recording studio and use these when I play. They are light and comfortable and have plenty of bottom end. This is one step up from the MDR-150. The only difference being the inline volume control. These also sound great with my phone or MP3 player.	1
I could not agree more on the issue not brought up here regarding xD memory that this camera is limited to. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD such as the C-5050 (drools over it). Together the people can control the market for our own good..	0

I do not understand the negative reviews.  I have had these headphones for years.  I wear them at work for hours at a time and can say from experience that they are comfortable. I really appreciate the volume control on the cord.  Unlike another reviewer, I have had no problems with it. I normally use these with either my computer or my iPod classic, listening to music, podcasts and audio books.  They sound pretty good for the money. They have also held up well.  Of course, they don't sound as good as my more expensive Sennheiser phones that I have at home.  They are just beginning to wear out, so I may be getting another pair just like them as a replacement.  There might possibly be better sounding phones for the same price, but I can say that these are comfortable and have lasted a long time and sound good enough for most purposes.  I don't think that you could do much better for the price.Update:I have had them for about 5 years and they finally broke. I am going to replace them with the same model. I use these at work and the in-line volume control is important to me in my work situation.  I can say from 5 years of experience that they are durable, comfortable and the volume control held up well for me.  The sound quality is adequate.  If you don't care about the volume control feature, as most people probably won't, you might want to spend a bit more on better sounding ones. For $20, I don't think that you could do very much better.  If you are after top sound quality, you probably aren't looking at these anyway, but I recommend the  Sennheiser HD555.  That is what I use at home.	1
I would imagine it was the cheap, crummy power supply, but mine wouldn't even light up...dead...One wonders why a $200 component can't run on 110 volts?  I'd try it again if they re-worked the power supply, but not if I have to use a DC adapter like a $3 item.	0

For $20, I don't think that you could do very much better.  If you are after top sound quality, you probably aren't looking at these anyway, but I recommend the  Sennheiser HD555.  That is what I use at home.	1
I would imagine it was the cheap, crummy power supply, but mine wouldn't even light up...dead...One wonders why a $200 component can't run on 110 volts?  I'd try it again if they re-worked the power supply, but not if I have to use a DC adapter like a $3 item.	0
The primary use for my GPS is city driving, and in LA it is a huge help.  To use this unit for city driving you must also purchase the MetroGuide USA CD's.  These CD's can upload data to the eMap.  This data includes addresses, businesses, and surface streets.  I also have the external antenna for my car, and I find this helps a lot when the unit is in the car.  It should be noted that it can not actually plan a route for you, but you can use the map to determine your route.  Also, it tells you how far away from your destination you are, and aproximately how long it will take you to get there.  I have set waypoints all over the city so that I can always find my way.  I can also punch an address in and it will show me right where that point is.  I never get lost anymore.  Many people also use this unit for hiking, or camping, and I have used it for this a couple times as well, and have found it very useful.  I have also taked it in the airplane and it is a kick to see where you are, and how fast you are going.  I have used a number of other units and find this one to be the most versatile, and great all around.	1
My Model CD started to have problems after one year of light use.  Initially the display would lose segments and then would require a power-down to restore.  This problem got worse with time.  After less than 2 years of use, the dosplay has now failed completely and the player rejects all disks from any manufacturer.  It was never a great sounding player, but having invested in several other Tivoli Audio components, I had no alternative but to live with their extremely expensive single disk unit. Obviously my unit is out of warranty and I am out of luck, but I would sure hope that this company (which is always boasting of it's audiophile roots) would help it's loyal customers out of this situation.	0

Garmin has a winner here - good screen, easy to use, and the maps are first rate.  Battery life is pretty amazing, the lock-on time is less than a minute, and it tracks well even in cars and aircraft.	1
This is one of my worst purchases.  Having taken some time to research MP3 players and owning a RIO, I wanted to buy something at the top end.  The Sony MZ-N10 seemed to be just right.  As far as the hardware goes it's great but the software is very poor and irritating.  Specifically, Sony have created a process of checking in and out the MP3 files, this works only some of the time, is non intuitive, very slow and also restricts the number of times the file can be transferred (3 times).  Compared to my RIO this device is a serious pain.  It's a shame as it's just the software, come on Sony provide an update which is non restrictive and fix the bugs!!!!	0

I wanted a GPS primarily for driving and finding addresses.  The Garmin EMAP deluxe does exactly for that purpose, and does it extremely well!First of all, if you want to find specific addresses, you need to get the metroguide CD and download detail map info into your GPS.  Otherwise, all you get is major roadways and highways.  You won't get lost, but if the house you're looking for is located on some local road, you won't find it.  You need a data cartridge to hold the detail maps.  The emap deluxe comes with an 8 mb cartridge.  8 MB is sufficient, although I think it should've come with 16 MB....  You also need a PC interface cable, which also comes with emap deluxe.8 MB will hold detail maps for approximately a radius of 25-30 miles.  If you're driving across states, bring a laptop and the cd.The screen is sufficiently large so that you won't have to scroll painfully.  The display is clear, and the backlighting is very nice in that you don't lose any contrast.  You can look at the thing in pitch blackness and you'll see the map extremely well.This gadget is extremely fun to watch, and very satisfying-- i.e. you won't be disappointed in terms of what it can do-- whether those functionalities are worth (the price), that's a different question.  If you drive a lot and get lost a lot, or if you wish you can find shortcuts if you're stuck in traffic, it's definitely worth it.  Also keep in mind that the metroguide CDs cost (extra).	1
Sony has decided that they will implement full music copy protection with this unit.  I'm a classical pianist and bought the Sony $99 electret microphone to record myself.  That works fine.  BUT Sony has decided that I just might have recorded a professional concert and does not allow me to copy music digitally from the unit to my computer.  Makes no difference that I AM the artist.  Sony has built a unit that assumes everyone is a thief and that can ONLY be used to copy digitally signed music that YOU ALREADY OWN.  Be warned that this makes the unit useless for most people.	0

I have used the eMap on several driving trips along the east coast and found it easy to use and the base map fairly accurate.  BUT, I purchased the Roads &amp; Recreation CD-ROM and found that maps in the North Carolina  region are over 5 years old.  I contacted Garmin and they confirmed that no  updates have been published and they have no policy regarding providing  updates to the maps!  While I like the functionality of downloading more  detailed maps into the GPS, investing $100 in obsolete maps and a company  who doesn't seem to view this as a problem bothers me.	1
Put me down as another consumer that has had to send back his N75/F75.  I received this camera new the other day.  But, right out of the box it was broken.  Seems on many of these models, when you try to load the film, it just backs it right in to the canister.  The 75 is supposed to unwind the film to the end of the roll and then as you shoot, it winds it back up to the canister so that when you are done, the roll is completely in the canister.  But, on mine, and many others, there must be a firmware bug.  I'm waiting on a replacement now.	0

I wrote a review on the emap a while back in April and am now reviewing  from a long-term perspective.The emap is still SO much fun to use. I use  it every time I go off-roading, cruising, bikeing, or hiking. I have not  yet had one glitch in the unit and it still runs as good as day one! It  hasn't gone through much toruture because it has been mounted in my SUV,  but it has held up very nicely!Since my last review, Garmin has updated  the software on the emap which adds a sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset  feature which is VERY NICE! It gives you an attractive little diagram of  the earth and where the sun and moon are along with written info.I have  used the emap to its capability and would still HIGHLY recommend this GPS  to anyone because it is very adaptable to any lifestyle. Garmin even makes  a handle bar mount for you to take it on your bike or atv. There are just  endless possibilities with this little contraption.Overall Grade: VERY  recommendable! If you want the technical info, look at my APRIL review.	1
(...)I Chat AV can't talk to any other videoconferencing system, though, and Apple bundles none of the usual Webcam software with the iSight. You can't manually adjust the brightness, the color balance, the white balance, or the contrast. You can't snap still pictures with the iSight, use it as a video camera, or feed video to the Web. You also can't use the iSight as a surveillance camera out of the box. And despite Apple's recent push for integration, iSight doesn't feed into iMovie.here is third-party software for all of these functions, and the iSight worked well with half a dozen Webcam applications we tried. The iSight even plugs into PCs, where we used it with Yahoo! Messenger and NetMeeting. But on a PC, the microphone doesn't work because it lacks a Windows driver (Apple says third parties are welcome to write such a driver).If all your friends and colleagues sign up for iChat AV, the $150 admission price for an iSight might be fine with you. But given that the iSight costs more than any competing wired Webcam, we had hoped buyers wouldn't need to spend even more on third-party utilities to get full functionality.	0

I bought this product when my old ball mouse went kaput on me.  So far, I'm happy with the optical mouse.  It glides effortlessly across the mousepad, unlike my old mouse.  What I like best about the optical versus the ball is its maintenance.  I don't have to worry about dust and particles finding their way inside the mouse.  Therefore, I don't have to take it apart to clean it, as I had to do with the old mouse.The scroll wheel was cumbersome at first; however, if you click gently on it while the cursor is pointed in the scrolling area, it works just fine.  This mouse comes with software, although it works fine without.  It also has an adaptor, which allows you to hook it up to a USB or PS/2 port.  I haven't tried it on my Performa yet, but if it works I think I'll go out and buy another one.	1
I will have to first admit that I only have one day's experience  with the Gmini.  All in all, the device does its job well; it is an  excellent external hard drive and transfers via USB 2.0 are fast.  The sound of the ear buds seem fine to me, and the UI isn't the best but gets the job done.Problems started, however, when I started trying to copy files from my CompactFlash card to the Gmini hard drive via the CF port (this is extremely important to me, since I bought this device primarily as a data vault for digital pictures while on vacation).I have three CF cards: Kodak (256MB), SimpleTech(128MB) and SanDisk(8MB).  Both the Kodak and the SimpleTech have problems in the Gmini (firmware 1.9).  You can browse the directory structure on the CF cards fine, but when you try to copy a file, the Gmini hangs; turning the device off is the only recourse.  In addition, whatever directory you were copying into on the Gmini's hard disk is now corrupted.In desperation, I popped in my SanDisk 8MB card.  Files from it copied perfectly.  Hmmmmmmm.Next step was to call tech support.  While not tremendously helpful, they seem to be loosely aware of the issue.  Their claim is that they have seen a problem with SimpleTech cards and with Lexar cards (they were especially emphatic about Lexar).  They are not sure whether it is a hardware or firmware problem, but the claim is that they are working on it.I plan to test some Viking, Kingston, and SanDisk cards tomorrow; according to another Amazon reviewer, these cards should work in the Gmini.  We shall see.[UPDATE 4/29/2004, based on my personal testing]:SimpleTech 128MB: NOKodak 256MB: NOSanDisk 8MB: YESSanDisk 64MB: YESViking 256MB: YESKingston 256MB: YES[END UPDATE]So, this is the main showstopping problem I have with this device.  As of today with firmware 1.9 on the Gmini, be very cautious about buying this device if you have "off-brand" CF cards such as SimpleTech, Kodak, Lexar, etc. and plan to use the CF port with these cards.A couple of other gripes: there is no belt clip, and the thing is way too big for a pocket.  Where does it go while you are walking/jogging?  Also, the earbuds are too large for my wife's ear, but that just might be an anatomical anomaly on her part.Also, the Archos website *clearly* states that the device ships with MusicMatch *Plus*.  Mine only shipped with MusicMatch Basic, which is the the free version that you can already download from musicmatch.com anyway.  This was important to me since the Plus version can rip mp3's 8x faster than the basic version.This player *will not* play secure WMA music files as of right now; I don't know if Archos is working on this or not.  So, don't plan on playing any of that music you downloaded from your favorite service (musicmatch, etc.) on this player.[UPDATE: according to tech support, secure WMA will never be added to the Gmini.  I always take what they say with a grain of salt, but....]Since there was a significant amount of bad, I'll restate the good: the price, 20GB can hold a *lot* of music, the USB 2.0 connection is fast.  Being able to hold 20GB of any data you like in a small portable device is just too useful.	0

I use this mouse on my Laptop computer (Dell Inspirion 8000, Pentium III 700MHz), usually on my couch in the family room and also on our deck. The optics work just fine on the arm of our couch (fabric material), and on our deck table.I'm running Windows Me, and using the USB connection. Installation was a breeze - just plug and play. I didn't even have to load the supplied software. The wheel works well, and the pointing precision is quite good.	1
In some ways this is the best mp3 recorder I've used.  It's extremely quiet.  It's compact.  Its controls are intuitive.  The rubberized portions of the case help prevent slipping.  The internal microphone does a great job.  It has two major flaws, however, and one is fatal.The non-fatal flaw is that an external microphone requires a preamp.  Preamps are not cheap.The FATAL flaw, which gave me no choice but to return it, is that IT HAS NO SHUTDOWN PROTCOL.  If the battery runs out while you're recording, YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING!!! (Guess who lost an entire evening of wonderful music made with friends.)If Archos would bring out a Gmini with a mic input and a shutdown protocol, you'd find my iRiver ihp-120 and my Sony high density Mini Disc recorder listed on eBay, half.com, or over here at amazon.---------------Added in edit:  I have no idea how to use these things effectively as MP3 players.  I want an effective recorder for music jams, so that's thew perspective from which I'm reviewing them.I've gone through a bunch of options. I've tried the iRIver 320 and 120.  I've got a Sony HiMD mini-disc.  I've been scouring the web for news/rumors of a forthcoming model by *anybody* that would meet all my needs.  The Marantz PMD660 looks promising...for $600 street.  I've given up.I realized that of all of them, the Archos was the best compromise.  While the lack of a shutdown protocol can be disastrous, it's straightforward (two button pushes) to save and start again.  The sound through the built-in mic and the highest quality mp3 microphone bitrate (112 kbps) are adequate.  The convenience of the Archos's drag-and-drop capabilites won out over the HiMD's ability to use an external mic. I'm not trying to approximate the sound of a studio recorder.  I admit I'm nervous about the many failures I've been reading about, but I got another one and this time I'm keeping it.  The current $50 Archos rebate didn't hurt either.When I took it out of the box, the up-button didn't always register, but it seems to be fine with a few minutes of use.  I've still got nearly 2 weeks to return it if it acts up again, but if I end up returning it, it will be for an exchange, not a refund.[...]I sold the iRiver ihp-120 on eBay.  I'm holding onto the HiMD recorder for the moment simply because I can run it off of AA batteries if I need something away from an electrical output for an extended period.  Otherwise, I'd get rid of it, too.	0

This is by far the best mouse I've ever used. I have one at work and one at home. It glides smoothly on just about any surface but if you want the best control and feel use a mouse pad. The only caveat is you can't use it on a mirror or clear glass surface. That's not a problem for me and I'll never go back to the old ball mouse.	1
The sound is great and this is a good price but the volume adjuster needs to be moved about toofrequently because that cheap part makes the sound cut out. If I could give it 0.1 star I would.	0

The sound is great and this is a good price but the volume adjuster needs to be moved about toofrequently because that cheap part makes the sound cut out. If I could give it 0.1 star I would.	0
I love my Microsoft optical mouse.  I like the ergonomic form, the scroll roller, and the ability to set the speed and clicks of the two buttons accurately.  However, I am now using the second one in about five months.The first sign that I had of the first mouse's unstable connection was that my system would lock up.  It required a complete shut down (cold boot) for the mouse to work.  I scanned for viruses, checked my drivers, and was rewarded by the flickering mouse that lasted a few more days.  The next step in my diagnosis was to remove several programs from startup; the mouse &quot;squeaked&quot; along nicely, but I noticed that the optical element was hot.  After a week of rebooting and keeping the mouse in a cool dry place it died.Because I liked the feel of the mouse, I bought a replacement.  A day after my mouse was installed the second identical mouse in the house experienced the death knell.  This one was replaced with a product from a different manufacturer.  The mice are very similar.Does the convenience of a favorite tool make up for the frustration of one that fails?  Maybe it does since I went right out and purchased another.  Because there are now two optical &quot;mice&quot; in the house, by two different manufacturers, I have time to decide what I will do next time.It is highly possible that my first mouse was a lemon.  The coincidence of the second mouse dying in approximately the same amount of time (five to seven months) is uncanny.  Does it mean that the problem is circuitry within the mouse or the power source in my house.Microsoft has so much confidence in the product they will take care of problems for three years.  This tells me that I may have just been unlucky with the previous two mice or I did not realize that it has delicate circuitry and abused the poor thing.  I did not take advantage of this warranty, which was my mistake.For me it rates three stars.  The new mouse is a five star jewel -- so far... so I guess it is 4 stars for the mouse.	1
I was happy with the Koss collapsible headphones when I first got them, but after a couple months of use the foam pads would not stay in place (kept coming off) and shortly after that the thin cable started fraying where it comes out of the inline volume control and finally stopped working.	0

This is a great camera, with wonderful features.  BUT...The red-eye reduction system does not work.  Instead of flashing twice, as most cameras do, the G2 projects a &quot;bright&quot; beam a light while you focus on your subject.  This beam is not bright enough to constrict the pupils in the first place, and is not wide enough to even hit the pupils in a typical composition.  You have to attempt to flash the beam in the subjects' eyes before taking the picture--very difficult to impossible.For this price, and considering all of the advanced features, I would expect better.  I cannot recommend this camera because of this egregious flaw.Canon G2 Owners: Please complain to Canon if this bothers you--maybe it could be fixed with a software upgrade.	1
They aren't very comfortable, are flimsy, and anyone within 100 feet will hear every lyric of your music without it being loud.Lacks bass too.	0

I bought a G2 a long time ago for almost $500. This is when they were a current model. Had it for many years with zero trouble. Great pictures, great flexibility, great feel. Finally bought a Nikon digital SLR and a Canon digital ELPH camera and stopped using the G2. Sold it n eBay in excellent shape for about $150 a couple of years ago.Bought several other Canon cameras in the meantime including a brace of SD1200IS's, an S3, a A70, and an S60. All nice to very nice cameras.Recently was looking through eBay and noted that G2's had fallen in price so that you got buy full kit G2's for about $50. In other words, free.So I bought one. It is awesome and I am in love with a G2 again. The handling is great, the full controls are great, the images are excellent. It is my favorite camera for when you don't need something tiny.If you want a true semi-pro digital camera for very little money, check out the G2 and it successors. Huge value and performance.	1
Usually, KOSS makes a good quality product at an inexpensive price.This time, they must have laid-off the quality control guy.An increase in volume is just an increase in treble, no boost in bass. Might as well stick with the sub-par ear-buds your device came with than use these.	0

I picked this camera because it received a 9 out of 10 at cnet.com along with the Nikon but this one was rated as more user friendly.  How true.  It has tons of functions I havent used but I was able to point and shoot for a 5 week trip to the UK.  According to my sister, 4 mega pixels is near professional quality (and allows you to blow an image up really large).  I didn't realize this when I bought it.  I just thought 4 would be better than 2.	1
For the first few months worked fine and setup was easy.  However after few months, it just died!  No warranty - nothing could be done.  This is the second Dlink router that has failed on me...I have switched to netgear - much happier!	0

We "adopted" our Canon Powershot G2 about two months ago-- our verdict so far?  Great camera for the serious digital photographer!  This is our second digital camera...We made the initial switch from our SLR to digital and have never retreated.The Canon G2 is a full-featured digital camera for those of us that love the control you have with a good SLR.  This model has all the manual adjustments for aperature, shutter speed etc., that you might be used to on your film camera.  At the same time, the G2 has many fully automatic settings for simple point and shoot, such as full program mode, macro (close-up), portrait, panarama etc.  In fact, if you are already a Canon SLR owner like us, you'll find many of the same controls you've already grown accustomed to.Features convincing us to purchase this camera over others include a flash hotshoe, rechargeable (in the camera) Lithium Ion battery, a decent sized 32MB Compact Flash Memory card, an excellent quality zoom lens and a really bright, adjustable LCD display.  We also like the ability to switch between various levels of color intensity similar to polarizing and other filters, as well as B&W; and sepia.  There are also settings to adjust for different outdoor and indoor conditions such as flourescent and incandescent light.  There are many more!A big surprise was the digital video recorder with sound.  I thought this would be little better than a toy, but the quality of images and audio were amazing.  Having said that, I wouldn't get this in place of a digital video camera, but if you occasionally like to shoot a few frames of video with sound to throw on a webpage it really comes in handy.So far we really haven't found a lot of downsides on this camera.You should pick up a larger compact flash memory card, but that shouldn't be too big of a deal with prices coming down....We shoot at 1600x1200 allowing us 219 exposures to work with.We also bought an additional Lithium Ion battery.  The Canon uses a proprietary battery charged in the camera.  The battery life is excellent allowing you to constantly use the LCD viewfinder and all features for more than a full day of shooting.  However, if you do happen to drain the battery, you'll be out of luck until you can stop somewhere to plug the camera in for a couple of hours.  Two batteries solve that problem....Availability of an external charger would be nice.  Currently Cannon offers an optional charger to use in your car only.The truth is there are so many features on the G2 that I can't write about them all here.If you are in the market for a high quality, full-featured digital camera as a long term investment, on par with your Nikon, Olympus, or Canon SLR film camera, this is the one to get.	1
I have had the exact same problem others describe.  It started off with a lock-up maybe once every few days, and then became progressively more frequent, until recently when it was locking up every 15-30 minutes.As a last ditch effort, I removed the outer case from the unit so it is sitting with circuit board exposed - have not had a lock-up for 48 hours. That suggests to me a high sensitivity to heat.I decided to replace it rather than wait for it to progress any further.  D-Link should probably offer something to users for such a seemingly frequent problem.	0

I've had this camera since April 2003, and it has been one of the best electronics purchases that I have made.  I've taken about 5,000 shots with this camera to date, and the image quality with all of them is outstanding, even by today's standards.This camera is capable of producing images up to 11x14 inches without noticeable image grainyness.  The F2.0 lens is superb and produces super sharp images.  The features are fantastic.  The panorama mode is something I use a lot more that I thought I would and produces stunning, seamless panoramas which could easily pass as gallery prints.If you can still find this camera, purchase it!  You will not be sorry.	1
I have had this unit for about 3 months now. Every so often it locks up (all the lights freeze) and it takes a power cycle to get it working again. One time if froze up and I had to reset back to factory default configuration. Fortunately I had save the configuration a day or two earlier and was able to reload it.Along with the occasional freezing I have noticed internet access problems which I had assumed were with Comcast. I have now discovered that the router quits passing data for about 3-5 seconds every minute or so when it's under load. It doesn't loose the wireless connection, but the data stream stops for several seconds. It appears to be long enough to drop instant messaging connections and file sharing connections.	0

The G2 was the third digital camera I bought and it immediately made the other two totally obsolete. It's not a conventional 35mm SLR camera but this thing is so close I am still amazed. Picture quality (for a digital) is superb! The battery pack is long-lasting, allowing you to take an endless parade of pictures before needing a recharge (and I have a 256 meg card in mine). The camera has sufficient weight to feel solid but is quite compact. And it's the first digital camera that I've actually had luck with the red-eye reduction feature. The 3X optical zoom is a blessing when you want to zoom in on something and still retain great clarity (digital zoom creates a grainy picture)and I've captured some fascinating pictures with the macro feature that allows you to get in close for detail shots or capturing the small things in the world. The different shooting modes make picture taking nearly fool-proof but the camera is flexible enough to allow you to be &quot;creative&quot; if and when you want to be.The movie feature allows you to capture &quot;mini&quot; movies of 30 second duration. Though the movie picture is small and grainy (compared to its regular shooting modes), it's a great little feature for capturing those spur-of-the-moment things.Improvements I'd like to see are faster focusing, shorter processing time, and shorter start-up time (program load-up) but these things are minor and can be overcome by simply knowing what to expect as I grow more accustomed to the camera's &quot;personality.&quot;Am I happy with the G2?  No.  I'm ecstatic!  It was worth every penny of its price. With its great image clarity, great focusing (though it can be a little tricky at times), and countless little features to explore, the Canon Powershot G2 is a heavenly piece of technology that actually exceeded my expectations quite handsomely. And if you're not very familiar with cameras, don't let all the little extras deter you from enjoying this gem because you can use it like a point-and-click (with focusing) until you're ready to explore its more advanced features.In short, this G2 is a sweet digital camera!	1
Worked fine for several months, had a few hang ups here and there but nothing I didn't expect from a router.After 3-4 months it started cutting out all the time, I would have to unplug it and wait a minute and then plug it back in, which only made it work for 10-20 minutes until it cut out again. Seems like this model is defective as a lot of other people have experience the same problem. I would pass on this router.	0

This is not a camera for the "point and shoot" crowd.  It has P&S; capabilities, but this camera is designed for the serious photographer-- the manual controls and creative options are where this camera stands out from the competition.The Canon Powershot G2 4MP packs loads of manual and semiautomatic adjustment and focusing control features into a relatively compact (it's somewhat boxy) and reasonably priced package.In addition to the standard features on would expect-- 4.1 megapixel sensor that creates 2,272 x 1,704 images for prints at 8 x 10 and beyond,  3x optical (plus 3.6x digital) zoom lens with autofocus,  a 32 MB CompactFlash card that holds 24 images at default resolution; Microdrive compatibility, USB port connections, etc., the G2 has some unique features, such as a swiveling LCD that allows you to point the screen up, down, sideways-basically in the same direction as the lens, whatever direction that may be.  This is handy for self portraits or when using the remote (which is included with the camera).Two video formats have also been included, allowing for 30 and 120 seconds of moving images with audio. Slow shutter-speed mode allows extended exposures in low-light situations. (A a NTSC cable for connecting to a television set is also included.)Also, the included software package goes beyond standard image processing with a remote capture function that allows complete control and manipulation of the camera functions from your computer keyboard. Canon's Stitch Assist program allows you to combine up to four images into one, seamless, panoramic view.The rechargeable BP-511 lithium-ion battery pack is exceptional.  I got over 340 shots on one charge-just amazing.  The battery and recharger are included with the camera.If heavy use of manual features is your thing-this is your camera.  If "point & shoot" is your thing-get a less expensive camera. With the G2 you'll just be paying for capacity and capabilities you'll never use or appreciate.	1
I sent this lens back when I could not get a reasonable depth of field. Bought a used Nikon 105mm micro and it gives me much better control and clarity.	0

I bought this camera in early 2003 when the camera was to be discontinued and sold around $400. I am mostly a happy user of this camera.Pros:1. Excellent lens, very bright (F2.0) which make shooting indoor without flash a possiblity.2. Good resolution. 4MP is enough even today.3. Great photography control, more F stops, great range of shutter speed which you won't see in most consumer level digital cameras. This means you can shoot a wide range of objects under many different environment, without compromised quality.4. Better looking than successors like G3, G5.Cons:1. Relatively lousy battery life using the bundled battery2. Slow startup time. This sometimes becomes intolerable when you want a fast shot.3. Hard to get CF card out of the camera.4. ISO 400 speed gives noisy image quality. However this is the issue with most consumer digital cameras.	1
Like so many others, I got the dreaded H03 error.  I consider it a complete outrage that Panasonic is not fixing this for free regardless of warranty status.  They know this is an original defect.  Selling these defective items is, IMHO, fraud. (I am no lawyer, but I believe that there is an implied warranty of reasonable service/peformance that does not depend on them promising 30/60/90 days or whatever.  I wish some feisty, class-action oriented lawyer would buy one of these dogs!)  Panasonic may think they are screwing us but they are screwing themselves.  Consumers have both tongues and memories.	0

I'll keep it short; this is a great camera and yeilds excelent pictures.  It is easy to use in the &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot; modes but also alows for flexibility if you want to go manual and get creative.The photos look every bit as good as film in a 5 x 7 format (considering that you use a good imaging equipment).  This says it all....  We took our photos down to the local photo shop to have them re=printed on high quality paper and the guy who owns the shop said that these were the best digital photos he's ever seen.  He asked my wife to give him the make and model number so he could check out the camera more.	1
Please be wary of the "good" reviews.  They are people who just bought the product and haven't had much experience with it.  I have experience with the product.I bought my player 4 months ago and loved it, at first.  But this morning I too got the dreaded H03 error.  And...I can't do a darn thing about it.Normally, I'd return it under warranty repair and pay my $90.  But, I'm sitting in Iraq right now, without my receipt to "prove" when I purchased it.  I can't even pick up the phone and call Panasonic because I'll be on hold more than the 15 minutes I'm allotted weekly, like I'll use those precious phone calls for them versus my family.  And I could pay the money and it still happen again in another 4 months while I'm here...So I'm stuck with it -- be aware, so it doesn't happen to you too.  I'm ordering another brand today and being done with it....So Panasonic...you're messing with the troops now too!  And I'm mad!	0
I'll keep it short; this is a great camera and yeilds excelent pictures.  It is easy to use in the &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot; modes but also alows for flexibility if you want to go manual and get creative.The photos look every bit as good as film in a 5 x 7 format (considering that you use a good imaging equipment).  This says it all....  We took our photos down to the local photo shop to have them re=printed on high quality paper and the guy who owns the shop said that these were the best digital photos he's ever seen.  He asked my wife to give him the make and model number so he could check out the camera more.	1

I have been using a Powershot S10 for the past 1 1/2 years.  I was totally amazed at the features of the G2.  I was preparing to upgrade to the G1, but I'm really glad I waited.The weight of the camera is pretty good.  I notice that it is more sensitive to camera shake and advises you so you can take better pictures.  I have noticed that it is more finicky in this area and requires you to make sure that you hold the camera steady.  I have tried using the camera in M (Manual Exposure) mode and there are so many more things to control for a much better shot!  I have tried using a Lexarmedia 48MB 8x CF card and a Sandisk 128MB.  No speed improvements for the 8X card.Coming from the S10 (Ni-MH battery) this 511 battery lasts so much longer!  Excellent battery life!All in all I find this camera to have great design and great features!  I intend on getting a LOEWPRO camera bag.  I noticed that some parts of the camera can scratch easily.	1
I was disappointed to learn that my DVD player had only a 90 warranty on labor.  For no reason error code H03 appeared requiring me to send the unit to McAllen Texas for service.  The service center informed me it would be $90.00 plus S&H for a remanufactured unit.  The unit was only six months old and probably had less than 100 hours on it.  I purchased Panasonic paying a $100 dollars more than other similarly equipped models hoping to avoid this type of issue.  The unit performed nicely during its short life, I hope I get more mileage from the replacement.	0

This review is largely taken from an online review of digital photography in general, and the iBook/iPhoto and Canon G2 in particular. The review is part of my personal/hobby ....I've been using the G2 fairly intensively for about 2 months. I use it in close combination with my iBook and iPhoto, together with GraphicConverter. I have some amateur photography expertise and a good amount of computing expertise.Overall I am very pleased with my experience, but I can say with certainty (and surprise) that we are still quite early in the digital phtography age. As excellent as this product is, there is vast room for improvement in both the G2 and in digital photography in general. The good news is that even in its current immature state it's worth doing.Pros and Cons follow:Pro: Shutter lag is tolerable if one can get focus lockCon: Focusing. The camera is often very slow to obtain focus lock. This means one presses the #!% shutter button and nothing happens. Manual focus is very clumsy (dismal) and hard to use, so the focus lock problem is serious and sometimes infuriating.Pro:Good optics.Con: Doomed optics. Uninspiring lens assembly design, silly device for attaching lenses and filters.Pro: RAW FormatCon: RAW Format: secret specifications, poor quality OS X versions of proprietary softwarePro: Solid, made in Japan. Relatively large lens allows some available light photography.Con: Big and heavy.Pro: LCD view panelCon: The worst optical viewfinder ever made for any camera.Pro: AC adapter brick not too heavy/bulky.Con: Flimsy cover for camera power/USB connections. AC Adapter clearly has a mismatched plug/cord that tends to fall out.Pro: Programmed settings.Con: Inability to save personalized settings.Pro: Macro featurePro: CF II supportCon: Bundled OS X software is incomplete or of poor quality; Canon refuses to share information with alternative developers. On the other hand the Windows software (installed on Win2K) is even lower quality, with major apps that simply didn't work.Pro: No SLR vibration, so decent photos at slow shutter speeds!Con: Artificial shutter sound is way too loud, even at the quietest setting. Inexplicable! Need an optical cue that a picture was taken as well as a much quieter shutter sound.Pro: Rapid shoot works well (disable flash)Con: Can't use exposure lock feature if display is turned off.Pro: Can use external flash.Con: Flash exposures are often poor. One gets correct exposure only between about 6 and 12 feet away, otherwise pictures with the built-in flash are either under or over exposed.Con: The camera will power down while images are being transferred to a laptop, even when the camera is plugged in. With JPG images I can transfer about 25 before this happens. If you use Canon's software you get a warning dialog from the software, but if you use iPhoto it simply gives an error message and an empty .jpg file is created. Need to disable auto-off during those transfers.Con: Automatic white balance is unreliable in daylight. Fails to recognize overcast light, must set this manually or images will be overly blue.Digital Problems (all contenders, not just the G2)- Shutter lag (time required from squeezing shutter to acquiring image)- Lithium battery has poor performance at low temperature.- CCD is "slow", about ISO 50-100. Can "push" to higher speeds, but more "noise" (unless super cool). Shutter speeds are slow.- Limited dynamic range and color discrimination.- Standards for image metadata and properties of camera are not well standardized and existing standards are not well supported.- Getting color right across output media is so complex people make a good living as consultants doing this.	1
The description sheet that was included in the plastic bag with the tubing listed some parts that were alleged to be included. They were not. There was only the tubing. I wrote to GE but did not receive a reply.Update: I received a reply from jascoproducts.com. They said I should return the product to Amazon (rather then them sending me the missing parts).	0

For an older camera it still competes with the newer ones. It was fully loaded for its day. I bought it because you can operate it with a battery powered remote control. I use it as a back up camera or when I want to be in a picture.	1
I bought a PodFreq and was dismayed at it's performance.  Not only was it next to impossible to mount in my vehicle, but I got all sorts of interference from cell phones, power lines and other people with fm tansmitters on the road with me.  I certainly expected something better for the price.  If an fm transmitter is your only option, look for something less expensive so you won't feel like you've wasted a bunch of money.  Be sure to check out all your options...there are a bunch of direct connect kits coming out at reasonable prices...check out circuit city for a couple of models for $100 or less.	0

I've hesitated making the switch to digital photography because of the stories I've heard about batteries that last 15 minutes before going dead, about the fact that you have to spend hundreds of dollars on storage media (provided that you don't have a laptop computer to immediately download photos) and talk from professional photographers that film is still where it is at if you want high quality shots.The Canon G2 has changed all those perceptions completely.  It is a great camera and I have taken probably close to 600 pictures since I got it less than a month ago. Of those, I've been able to immediately delete one-third of those pictures because of things I didn't like with lighting, closed eyes, etc.  This is something I couldn't do with my SLR camera and thus I will eventually save a lot of money in film developing costs and I will have better quality images.The pictures are incredible.  I compared similar pictures I took with my Canon Elan 7E 35MM SLR (a great camera in its own right) and my Canon G2 digital camera and I think the quality of the latter pictures is better.  Combined with the savings on film and developing and time saved by not having to scan pictures for editing in Photoshop, etc., the choice of going digital is easy.I do recommend that if you get this camera and intend to take indoor shots to get an external flash unit in Canon's EX series.  The flash that comes with the camera gives me significant "green eye" when I took pictures of my dogs (a common problem when taking pictures of pets even with film), even with the red-eye reduction activated, but the bounce flash ability of my Canon 380EX Speedlite reduces this problem significantly (the 420EX is the newest in the Speedlite line).Battery life is also not a problem.  I bought two additional batteries when I bought my camera based on the concerns voiced earlier about short life, but even after 600 shots, I am still working off my initial charge.  Granted that almost all my shots were indoors so I'm not sure how much drain there will be due to elements, but I have also taken them with the monitor, so battery life is pretty good.  You probably might want to get a second battery just to be on the safe side.Compact flash cards still can be pricey, but deals can be found where you might be able to get them for a good price and these prices will no doubt come down over time.  Viking Components compact flash cards are very good and fairly inexpensive compared to other brands.  I also think a cheap laptop or an image storage unit whereby you can store the images from the compact flash cards would be a good investment as well, especially if you plan to travel ...The Canon G2 is a great camera for the semi-serious photographer.  Grab one while you can!	1
Did not work with my car FM at all and even when 12 inches from my Home Stereo FM antenna I get mostly static.  If this is the best FM tranmitter for the iPod then  I suggest you wait for the next generation of these products.	0

After many helpful reviews off the NET and hands on testing in many stores - I am very happy with this product. So easy to use. The build quality is top notch, performace is very quick when taking pictiures and reviewing them PLUS the controls are so intutive. Images are razor sharp!Camera also comes with a little remote cntrol!!!!!Sell your old stuf and get this one!! You won't be dissapointed!	1
I ve been using this mouse for almost a week now! The first day i got the mouse, it looked pretty kool to me. Was very small handy and light weight, however the installation guide wasn't very helpful but i still managed to install it in less than 5 minutes. The bad thing started the next day when i realized the next morning that though the mouse was turned off it just comsumed up all the battries which were included in the package, i ve changed the battried though and those are working fine now for the 3rd day. Another bad thing about it is that it won't work well on all the surfaces. It requires some non-reflecting and rough surface for best results.	0

The Canon PowerShot G2 is a little smaller than the PowerShot S1 IS, which I have. The G2 can take half-minute, low-res/low-quality sound movie clips. Generally, photos by the G2 are not as grainy (especially dark colors) than the S1 IS, but not because it has 0.8 more MP.Based on my experience, chromatic aberration was often lower on the G2, but can still come out somewhat fuzzy in some situations, e.g. not suited for professional photography. For example, taking a picture of a table you are to include in a sell sheet for a brochure, the nameplate was unattractively hard to read. Overall, the G series IMO was very fast like a point-and-shoot.It is not compact enough to fit in an average pocket. The lens cap fit more securely than on the S1 IS.I would highly recommend this camera if high-quality family, outdoor, etc. photos are your ticket, even if the camera does not have RAW mode. Some G series have RAW mode. (Sorry, I did not check to see if the G2 has it.)By the way, regardless of lighting conditions, the G2 did very well. The S1 IS can take decent photos in low lighting as well, but focusing during movies was a challenge, especially indoors.My only complaint about the G2 is it takes a lithium battery pack, unlike the S series that takes four AA batteries. Either way though, the battery life is very good, that and the camera will work for many years if proper care is heeded.Pros:Photo quality: 5/5Battery life: 5/5Durability: 5/5Shelf life: 5/5 (in this instance)Con:Movie quality: 1/5 (common for a camera in its day)Five stars on this one, Canon!	1
Verbatim DL used to be by far the best DL media available. Reliable, stable in storage, and consistent high quality made by Mitsubishi in their Singapore plant, one of the highest quality DVD production plants in the world.Not any more. Verbatim has outsourced a large part of their DL production to a plant in India, and now when you buy this media you have a high chance of getting made in India - this product is poor, often with obvious physical defects in the media like bubbles, holes and foil delaminates.It is possible to still find made in Singapore cakeboxes on store shelves, but if you can't actually read the disk label before buying you are rolling the dice when you buy.It is a real shame Verbatim does not offer the Singapore product as a diferent grade. It would be worth a few extra bucks to get a cakebox that had a 95% success rate vs. the 50% rate the made in India product gives.Verbatim has really gotten a black eye in my book with this stunt.	0

After working with this camera at the store at which I am employed, I have come to the conclusion that all around, this is the best high-end consumer grade digital camera.  There are several ways in which this camera comes out on top over the cameras made by its competitors.More than likely, the camera people will compare this to is the Nikon Coolpix 995--at least these are the two cameras most people narrow it down to.  Each camera offers things that the other doesn't, but I find the Canon is superior in several ways.1.  The Canon is *far* more user friendly.  The controls are laid out in a way that makes them easy to find.  SLR users that are converting from film to digital will find the switch to be a little easier with the Canon.  One thing I don't like about the Nikon is the way manual control works; hold down this button, move this switch, push down that button while moving that switch, etc etc.  Way too complicated for the average consumer.  On the Canon it's a breeze.  Switch the control to &quot;M&quot; and the 4-way pad on the back up the camera controls aperture and shutter speed.  That's it.2.  The Canon uses an anti-reflective coating on the screen.  Nikon and Olympus *still* don't do that with their consumer grade cameras.  The anti-reflective coating helps heaps when you're out in the sun, where the screens on most other cameras get faded out and are impossible to see.3.  The rechargable battery that comes with the Canon lasts far longer than other camera batteries (i.e. AA's or the rechargables Nikon uses).  You could easily get over 200 shots from a single battery, with the LCD screen on.4.  The software package the Canon comes with blows away what Nikon and Olympus give you.  Adobe Photoshop--the standard in the graphics industry.5.  The Canon comes with a 32 megabyte card, which is 2x what most manufacturers ship the camera with.6.  Two words -- hot shoe.  Right on the camera.  Who wants to carry around a bulky flash bracket when you can buy a camera that a standard flash attaches right to?If you've read reviews from computer magazines or from digital camera websites, you'll see that the Canon gets consistently high reviews.  In a recent review, the G2 was rated #1 over the Coolpix 995, which the reviewers claimed produced pictures which weren't quite as sharp as the ones from the G2.  I've been waiting to buy a digital camera.  When I have the means, I am very confident this is the one I'll go with.	1
Out of 20 disks, had 8 coasters. This at 2.4x using a LiteOn SATA drive. Switched to Memorex 8x, still burning at 2.4x, no problems so far.I don't recommend these disks. They are more expensive than the Memorex and don't work as well.	0

I've been waiting to buy a digital camera.  When I have the means, I am very confident this is the one I'll go with.	1
Out of 20 disks, had 8 coasters. This at 2.4x using a LiteOn SATA drive. Switched to Memorex 8x, still burning at 2.4x, no problems so far.I don't recommend these disks. They are more expensive than the Memorex and don't work as well.	0
The G2 is my third digital camera, and the first that lets me control images the way I'm used to with film camera. WIth multiple programs as well as full manual override, I can pretty much do anything with the G2 that I can with any of my 35mm cameras, so long as I don't intend to enlarge the images too much. For web work it's fantastic, and for prints up to 8x10 it's pretty darn good. Decent 11x14s are possible if you pick your subjects carefully.It's not perfect by any means. The in-camera charger is a pain to use, and the batteries and auto charger are very expensive. The focal range of the lens is equivalent to a 35-105 in 35mm, which is not as wide as I'd like to go (I use my 24mm lens a lot in 35!). But aftermarket batteries and chargers are available, as are aftermarket accessory lenses. I've found good deals in both by hunting around on a web a bit.And the plusses far outweigh the negatives. The swivelling monitor  is one of the best designs I've seen on a digital camera. The IR remote allows me to take photos with the hamera held 6' over my head on a monopod. The manual control makes astrophotography possible. And so on.For the price, I think it's one of the best deals in 4 Mpixel cameras. Automatic enough for the newcomer, yet with all the manual flexibility a pro might want. I'm happy with my choice.	1
The disks are fine. Verbatim are always excellent. Given 2 stars to point out that these are 2.4X speed.Verbatim 97000 are the same price at Newegg and are 8x. I use those and never burn a coaster with my cheap? ASUS burner.Why buy 2.4x when you can buy Verbatim 8x. It takes 3 times as long to burn.	0

Try'm I did, 5 different digital cameras, and ended up with the Canon G2.  2, 3.3, 3.9, 4, 5 mega pixal, I tried 'emOh I did keep 1 of the other 5, the Nikon 995, primarly for the extra wide angle lens, and the extra focal length of the telephoto. And besides after all these years (a Nikon Man) I can't jump ship at this stage of life.I do believe though that when I jump back into this thing w/both feet it will be the Canon EOS D60Oh the G2 ain't in any matter of the e-magination perfect, but ask youself, what is?But give'em credit there trying.	1
Got write errors on two different burners.  They will play on the computer where I burned them (sort of) but no DVD player attached to a TV will touch them.Nasty -- avoid these.	0

The Canon PowerShot G2 is, hands down, the finest compact, high-end, amateur/professional digital camera on the market today.  Together with the lens adapter, the teleconverter (1.5x) and wide-angle lens available, it simply can't be beat.  Before I purchased this camera I spent several hours personally comparing it to every other 3+ megapixel camera currently on the market, and there is simply no comparison with any other.  I would not pretend to compare this camera to the Canon EOS D30 and the even newer D30x with it's use of interchangeable, incomparable EF lenses, but photography, not simply digital photography just leaped another millennium with Canon's improvements over the 1-year old PowerShot G1.The Product Review and other personal review at this site have provided you more of the technical aspects of this jewel, so I will spare any repetition--except to say that the ability to use my 550EX flash normally used with my Canon EOS-3 and 1v is not only teriffic but a great money saver.Don't be fooled by the stylish looks of other digitals--not that they are slackards by any means (such as the Dimage 7), but it's performance, although outstanding, seems elementary alongside the G2.ENOUGH SAID!	1
The discs are great when they work properly.  But about 1 in 3 of the discs I got in this spindle have failed to write.  I have been using these discs for quite some time for backups, but this last spindle never should have made it off of the factory line.  Poor quality control on the discs...	0

This is the kind of camera that is a joy to use and explore. I have been using this along with a Digital SLR for about 3-4 years now and it still works great. I must have shot over 10000 shots using this camera with most shots being exceptional. The lens is fantastic, build is rugged, battery life is exceptional. This is a classic camera worth keeping for many years. For an avid photographer, the Powershot 'G' series is a good camera to have along with an SLR.	1
None of them worked. I had errors on all three of them.  I bought the Ridata and perferct burning on all of them...	0

This is my first Canon camera and now I know what Canon fans have been raving about all these years. This is a well-built, well-designed, and well-executed digital camera. It certainly is intended for a advanced user or &quot;prosumer,&quot; but I believe it can also serve as a good camera for a beginner who knows he or she will advance in skill.Most beginners buy a point and shoot camera and then upgrade to something more expensive if they &quot;get into&quot; photography. The G2 can work as a point and shooter. It has a fully automatic setting. And the pictures it takes are extraordinary. At 4 megapixels, they are as good as any amatuer user will ever need given the capability of home printers.As you grow in confidence, and want to experiment with adjustments to shutter speeds, ISO, manual focus, etc., etc., it is all here and organized in a logical and accessible manner. The camera will even take short movies, though I doubt that feature is any more needed than the snapshot feature on digital camcorders.You need to hold this camera to really appreciate how well built it is. So many digital cameras look and feel &quot;cheap&quot; even if they cost multiple hundreds of dollars. The G2 is solid and attractive.I particularly enjoy the innovative LCD screen which flips out and rotates like those on camcorders. It also flips completely over for self-portraits (very convenient with the wireless remote) and can be turned toward the camera and snapped into place to protect the LCD from scratches while transporting.I researched several cameras before I purchased the Canon G2. I don't regret my choice in the slightest. The G2 is more expensive than some, but it is so versatile that I expect I will actually save money because I can't think of a thing I might need as my skills advance that this camera won't provide.	1

One week and I'm infatuated with the capabilities, ease of use and the remarkable images possible with this 4 megapixel wonder.  This is my first digital camera purchase and based one what I saw in the G1, which was very close for me, I purchased sight unseen the G2.  The layout is extremely intuitive, so much so that my wife, who has never handled a digital camera, was able to access the playback mode and erase ... pictures I'd taken her.  Features I like:  The rotating LCD screen which allows the camera to be used from any position.  Navigating through the many features available is a snap with the rotating mode dial.  Snap mode is like infinity focus, good for those street shots.  The shutter is responsive, and there is no lag between what you see and what you shoot.  I tried this by pointing camera out window and waiting for a car to enter window frame.  When car doing 35-40 mph was fully in narrow window frame, I snapped, and captured exactly what I saw.  You can select either 0, 2 or 10 sec. review mode, depending on how fast you want to shoot.  Pictures are very sharp, color is accurate and it is wildly easy to use. Manual focus capabilities.  Five resolution modes including a RAW format of 2272 x 1704, which equals a 7.5" x 5.5" image at 300dpi, the minimum for hi-res, magazine and book reproduction.  (8" x 10" image at max res. is 228 dpi without resampling). Software for PC and Mac is effortless and includes Photoshop LE.  Very efficient and no bugs.  A few nitpicks are:  It is a handful.  The charge and USB port door isn't the sturdiest.  The startup music has to go.  Software takes up lots of MBs.  Learning camera, but so far so very, very good.UPDATE: November 16, 2003.I still have this camera.  The 2nd week I owned camera -see above for date - I received a magazine assignment.  Hauling out the film gear, I suddenly realized - I could use the G2!  I purchased an adaptor - SafeSync - to protect circuits and reduce the voltage of high powered Norman strobes to 6 volts.  Adaptor fits in G2 hotshoe.  It may have seemed a little odd to the CEO when he strolled up to my elaborate lighting setup and I whipped out this little camera, but the shoot was successful and paid for the camera. Since then have done many many assignments with this camera and just last week used it for a shoot for the Wall St. Journal.  Why haven't I upgraded?  Because I haven't had a need to.  This is truly an amazing camera.	1
these dvd work well, but thier use is limited. while they can be used to make movies with high quality, only limited dvd players can read them...and even fewer read them right. it seems that technology has already moved on to BD and HD dvds without bothering to perfect the DL technology for the mean time.	0

I am a long-time digital camera user, having owned a Kodak DC-265 (which I gave away only recently) and a Sony Mavica CD1000 (which I still use for its excellent 10x optical zoom). Until recently, I also owned a wonderful 35mm Canon EOS Rebel 2000 film camera with grip extender and a Canon Speedlite flash (which works with both the EOS and the Powershot G2 -- one reason I bought the G2!). I'm in love with digital since most of my work ends up on my wildtexas.com website or emailed to family and friends.I own a 1 gigabyte IBM Microdrive (Compact Flash II) and one of my criterion for purchasing a new digicam was that it supported this format, since I have many different Compact Flash media thanks to my years in digital photography and my interest in Pocket PC PDAs. Since this is a 4 megapixel camera, I'd recommend at *least* a 128 MB CompactFlash card or greater.When my G2 arrived in the mail, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover it was such a sturdy little camera -- heavier than I imagined, but stronger as well. One of the things I dislike about my Mavica is it's so big and bulky -- awkward to hold. The G2, in contrast, is smooth, streamlined and solid in a built-to-last kind of way. I took photos with it at an airshow recently, using the ingenious flip-around viewscreen as I shot the camera over my head (due to crowd obstructions). While the camera got heavy in my hand over time, it let me take shots I would never have been able to manage with my Mavica -- and the videos, while not feature-film worthy were perfect for web use and sharing with friends (the sound recorded is particularly good!)One caveat, and this is for all camera owners (both digital and 35mm) -- buy a good camera case to protect your investment! Lowe Pro bags are perfect for folks who spend a lot of time outdoors, like I do, since many of their bags have attached Gore-Tex rain hoods. The G2 fits perfectly in the Lowe Pro D-Res 30 bag I own, with plenty of room to spare for accessories.The battery life is superb. As an example, I went to the airshow with my Mavica CD1000 and my Powershot G2 fully charged. After taking 15 second videos and some stills for about 30 minutes, my Mavica's battery died. I then switched exclusively to shooting with my G2, and it lasted not only for the 4 more hours we were at the airshow, but also through an entire additional day of off-and-on usage; it still had juice in it when I decided it was a good time to start recharging in, in preparation for our next outing. It's a digital photographers and webmaster's dream come true!I highly recommend getting the largest storage card you can afford and shooting all your images in RAW mode. While this makes downloads to your computer take longer, it ensures you have the HIGHEST quality digital images possible, giving you maxiumum opportunities to do things like get big reprints from a pro lab. With my Microdrive and all RAW images, plus video clips, I still never worry about how much memory I have left.Another bonus of the G2 being so solidly built is I have much less worries about my delicate Microdrive getting harmed when in the camera as I used to when the drive lived in my PDA. The Microdrive is well protected in the G2's body, versus being relatively exposed (with just a flimsy plastic cover) when I used it in my PDA. There's even a CF card eject button, thus eliminating the fear of Microdrive owners far and wide about harming their cards when removing them.Fantastic camera for a worthy price!	1
Ordered the Verbatim 8.5GB 6X Double Layer DVD+R DL Disks (20pk Spindle) and received 2.4x Speed DVD+R DL Disks instead.  Amazon was nice enough to tell me to keep what was sent and told me they would send me a new order with the 6X speed. Guess What!!!  They again sent me the 2.4 speed disks. I would not recommend this purchase since the they still show that the disks are 6X speed on their web site and what you actually receive are the 2.4X Disks.	0

If you sort the reviews already available here by "Most Helpful", you'll notice that the technical features that made Powershot series a pain in the rear of Nikon/FujiFilm/Olympus are already well documented.The bundled ancillaries (software, maintenance stuff etc) is unarguably the best on the market, period, the support for IBM's 1 GB microdrive (which Nikon did not have until recently), the hot shoe being right on the camera, the superb CanonScan software that makes it a cinch to get your snaps on your machine even for tech-phobic folk, the sturdier heavier body of the camera that makes it easier to balance,  CP-10 card photo printer support, the new vivid color mode, the wireless remote control, the plethora of compatible flashes (Speedlite 220EX, 380EX, 420EX,  and 550EX to be precise), the possibility of recording videos WITH sound up to 120 seconds, or 30 seconds in a larger frame size (Nikon wannabes note...until recently, Nikon did not support sound in videos) ...etc etc.Yes, all of this is outstanding and even if you don't get most of it, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED eventually after you have used and discovered your G2 Powershot for while, when you find out why Canon was the best choice you could have made!HOWEVER, amidst the celebration of all this doohickey one thing we often neglect to consider is the quality of the pictures themselves -- isn't THAT the main purpose of a camera, digital or otherwise? All the convenience in handling, maintaining and uploading wouldn't be worth jack if the pictures themselves looked better with another camera!And in this important department of "quality", I have always wanted to compare G2 and Nikon's top comparable options (specifically 995, 4300 and 5700) because these are the only two brands that'll give you near-pro functionality and quality at consumer prices (apologies to FinePix/Olympus owners).I had the luxury recently of trekking with friends who own Nikons 4300 and 995 respectively. Pretty much the ONLY thing I've found Nikon-freaks mentioning since the release of G2 is the oh-so-exalted Nikor lens because Canon beats Nikon hands-down in pretty much every other department as noted above. Me and my 2 friends are all more or less at a similar level of expertise with photography, none professional. But all have owned and worked with our camera for a while and read the manuals thin.Here is what I believe after head-to-head comparisons, your mileage may vary --OUTDOOR PICTURES IN BRIGHT LIGHT:Canon's colors were more real. Clarity is good with all 3 cameras but Nikon seemed a little reddish to me.PICTURES IN LOW LIGHTING (INDOOR OR NIGHT PICTURES):This is where Canon where truly leave you in "shock and awe" (sorry for the choice of words). I was stunned with some of Canon's ultra-realistic  pictures when only a candle was on in a room for example.FIGURES/FACES OF PEOPLE:Unfortunately, even with a lot of tweaking, Nikon is just simply better at faces of people for some reason. Canon is too, er, "real"? We agreed that with Nikon ...the colors, shades, contours of the same face can be made to look a little better than with Canon -- and I am excluding software based trickery of course.DEFAULT MODE:If you opt to use only the default modes in Canon and Nikon, then Nikon will win in terms of photo quality. Canon provides excellent detail and clarity, but the default mode has the now notorious "white specks" or dotted edges. This is easily taken care of with some adjustment (read the manual).ALL IN ALL: I feel Canon's results are more "honest". It just captures the reality in every sense-- colors, the range of what your eyes see etc. This usually means it is better for me, but if my pictures were going to be mainly of people I would also give the Nikons a good look.Otherwise, Canon G2 Powershot is the best there is. Even better than the new G3 (for now).	1
I used the Memorex DVD+R DL DVDs before buying the Verbatim ones.  Out of a Memorex 20-pack I didn't burn a single coaster using Nero.  Out of the first 10 Verbatim discs, however, I've burned 3 coasters.  One of the coasters was obvious, as you could see many imperfections in the disc right after I removed it from the cake box.  The edges of all of the discs look ragged and cheap.  I would not recommend this brand of dual layer DVDs and I won't buy them again.	0
If you sort the reviews already available here by "Most Helpful", you'll notice that the technical features that made Powershot series a pain in the rear of Nikon/FujiFilm/Olympus are already well documented.The bundled ancillaries (software, maintenance stuff etc) is unarguably the best on the market, period, the support for IBM's 1 GB microdrive (which Nikon did not have until recently), the hot shoe being right on the camera, the superb CanonScan software that makes it a cinch to get your snaps on your machine even for tech-phobic folk, the sturdier heavier body of the camera that makes it easier to balance,  CP-10 card photo printer support, the new vivid color mode, the wireless remote control, the plethora of compatible flashes (Speedlite 220EX, 380EX, 420EX,  and 550EX to be precise), the possibility of recording videos WITH sound up to 120 seconds, or 30 seconds in a larger frame size (Nikon wannabes note...until recently, Nikon did not support sound in videos) ...etc etc.Yes, all of this is outstanding and even if you don't get most of it, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED eventually after you have used and discovered your G2 Powershot for while, when you find out why Canon was the best choice you could have made!HOWEVER, amidst the celebration of all this doohickey one thing we often neglect to consider is the quality of the pictures themselves -- isn't THAT the main purpose of a camera, digital or otherwise? All the convenience in handling, maintaining and uploading wouldn't be worth jack if the pictures themselves looked better with another camera!And in this important department of "quality", I have always wanted to compare G2 and Nikon's top comparable options (specifically 995, 4300 and 5700) because these are the only two brands that'll give you near-pro functionality and quality at consumer prices (apologies to FinePix/Olympus owners).I had the luxury recently of trekking with friends who own Nikons 4300 and 995 respectively. Pretty much the ONLY thing I've found Nikon-freaks mentioning since the release of G2 is the oh-so-exalted Nikor lens because Canon beats Nikon hands-down in pretty much every other department as noted above. Me and my 2 friends are all more or less at a similar level of expertise with photography, none professional. But all have owned and worked with our camera for a while and read the manuals thin.Here is what I believe after head-to-head comparisons, your mileage may vary --OUTDOOR PICTURES IN BRIGHT LIGHT:Canon's colors were more real. Clarity is good with all 3 cameras but Nikon seemed a little reddish to me.PICTURES IN LOW LIGHTING (INDOOR OR NIGHT PICTURES):This is where Canon where truly leave you in "shock and awe" (sorry for the choice of words). I was stunned with some of Canon's ultra-realistic  pictures when only a candle was on in a room for example.FIGURES/FACES OF PEOPLE:Unfortunately, even with a lot of tweaking, Nikon is just simply better at faces of people for some reason. Canon is too, er, "real"? We agreed that with Nikon ...the colors, shades, contours of the same face can be made to look a little better than with Canon -- and I am excluding software based trickery of course.DEFAULT MODE:If you opt to use only the default modes in Canon and Nikon, then Nikon will win in terms of photo quality. Canon provides excellent detail and clarity, but the default mode has the now notorious "white specks" or dotted edges. This is easily taken care of with some adjustment (read the manual).ALL IN ALL: I feel Canon's results are more "honest". It just captures the reality in every sense-- colors, the range of what your eyes see etc. This usually means it is better for me, but if my pictures were going to be mainly of people I would also give the Nikons a good look.Otherwise, Canon G2 Powershot is the best there is. Even better than the new G3 (for now).	1
I used the Memorex DVD+R DL DVDs before buying the Verbatim ones.  Out of a Memorex 20-pack I didn't burn a single coaster using Nero.  Out of the first 10 Verbatim discs, however, I've burned 3 coasters.  One of the coasters was obvious, as you could see many imperfections in the disc right after I removed it from the cake box.  The edges of all of the discs look ragged and cheap.  I would not recommend this brand of dual layer DVDs and I won't buy them again.	0
I am very pleased with this camera. It takes great pictures and gives you as much control over the picture as you need. It's very easy to use, whether your a novice or a more seasoned photographer.I gave it a four instead of five for two reasons. The first is the lack of an external charger. The battery for this camera can only be charged in the camera. This makes having two batteries less useful since you can't charge one while using the other. Unless of course you want to spend even more money on the external charger. The second reason is when using the extension for use with filters and other lenses you can get a very bad shadow in the lower right hand corner of the picture from the extension. Of course, there is a way to correct this, purchase an external flash for the camera, which it can use. ... This is less of an issue than the first, but I have found it to be a problem on more than one occasion.One last thing; if your looking for a camera for Astrophotography, digital is NOT the way to go. Stick with 35mm SLR cameras. You can't get the exposures necessary for good astrophotography with digital cameras. The technology just isn't there yet.Good luck and enjoy the camera, if you purchase it. You won't regret it, I sure don't.	1
Amazon is incorrectly advertising this as being able to be burned higher than 2.4X. That speed is the highest that is officially given on the label of the 50-Disc Spindle (96577) that I received.

I owned a G2 for over 6 months.  After taking over 4,200 pictures, I am still amazed by what this camera can do.  I use this for my wedding photography business and my clients are all very happy with the prints from the G2.  The picture quality is excellent, I printed many 8X10 photos and seen many jaws dropped when I told them that is from a digital camera.If you are serious about indoor photography, an external flash is a must.  The Canon 420EX is an excellent companion to the G2.The G2 is not perfect, there is room for improvement.  The G2 could use a better and faster low light focusing system.  The manual focus could be made better with a focusing ring.  Faster shutter response time would be nice too.  Overall, the G2 is an excellent camera that I would recommend.  If you want a simple point and shoot, the G2 might be an overkill.  However, if you are an amaturer photographer, this is the camera for you.	1
These are supposed to be the best disks around but I just burnt a lot of coasters!  I also bought some Windata DVD+R DL disks for a third of what these cost and actually had better success.  Maybe it's my Macbook Pro that doesn't like these, but whatever, I'm going to stick to the cheaper disks they seem to work better for me.	0

This is a camera for everyone.  Simple operation, ample accessories and extra features usually offered on only much more expenxive cameras.-- Can be used with or without viewfinder.-- 4.0 MP provides miraculous images!-- Movie mode for 30 second clips is fabulous.-- Easy data transfer to PC.-- Self-photo timer is fabulous!-- Excellent value.-- Compact Flash Media format is so easy to use, not to mention convenient!In conclusion, there is not a better digital camera on the market, at any price!	1
I bought a 20 pack a few months ago. I got one good burn out of 20.  Not sure whats up. I use a new sony DVD writer and a 2.6GHz pc with 1.5GB ram.  The singles work flawlessly but a DL disk just dont wanna work. I tried Nero, CloneDVD2 and XPcdburner. Tried 2.4x and 1x. No good burns.	0

I like my Canon G2's &quot;stealth mode.&quot;  Its f/2 lens shoots in low light without a flash.  Other digital cameras have an f/2.8 lens, requiring twice the light.  Plus the viewscreen flips out and rotates.  I can put the camera on the floor, against a wall, on a glass on a table, etc. allowing me to shoot at slow shutter speeds without a tripod. And because I'm not holding the camera to my eye, subjects don't realize I'm shooting pictures.  Lastly, the camera is completely silent.  Candid shots vs. posed pictures look completely different.  Posed, people make faces, stick out their tongues, etc.  Or they refuse to let me take pictures.  In contrast, in candid shots people look natural.Then after I take the pictures, everyone wants to look at the pictures. This makes you popular at parties. Even the people who said they hate pictures of themselves want to look through the shots, and they love the pictures!  I feel like saying, &quot;Duh, if you stick out your tongue and scrunch up your face when you pose for a photo, you'll hate the pictures of yourself!&quot;After using the Canon G2 you become aware of how obtrusive other cameras are: flashes going off, the loud snap of a 35mm camera, etc.I also like the video mode. It takes pretty good 30-second videos, with sound. And, again, people don't react the way they react to someone shoving a video camcorder in their face. They ignore the little camcorder, and then are delighted to watch the video.I like the &quot;continuous&quot; or &quot;motor drive&quot; mode, which takes up to 2.5 frames per second. For sports this is essential. For portraits it's useful: you tell the subject to smile, and you get a dozen shots to pick from, of every stage of the smile.The &quot;macro&quot; mode makes close-ups of little things easy.I also like that shooting hundreds of photos is free! The battery has never run out, and recharges quickly. But my 256MB card is too small. I'm upgrading to a 1GB card. As you learn to use this camera, you'll find yourself shooting far more pictures than you did with other cameras.I've used my G2 heavily for almost a year, and it has never broken down.My complaints about the G2:- The &quot;AUTO&quot; and &quot;P&quot; modes should not be used.  These set the shutter speed at 1/640th of a second.  This is much faster than is necessary, diminishing your depth of field, using the flash unnecessarily, etc. Instead, I taped a reminder to the back of my camera, saying to use aperture priority at f/2 and 400 ISO in very low light, aperture priority at f/2 and ISO &quot;AUTO&quot; (50 to 100) in low light, shutter priority at 1/125 and ISO &quot;AUTO&quot; in medium light; and aperture priority at f/8 and ISO 50 in bright light.- The &quot;auto&quot; white balance should also be avoided.  It often looks bad, often very bad. The manual settings (sunlight, tungsten, etc.) are easy to use and look great. I never need to use the manual white balance.- Using autofocus and autoexposure result in a half-second lag between pressing the shutter release and taking the picture. You can get around this by using the &quot;continuous&quot; mode, or using manual settings.- The G2's 34-104mm lens is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but there are times I've wanted a longer telephoto lens.- 4 megapixels isn't as good as a pro 35mm camera. For 95% of my shooting it's adequate, but sometimes I wish I had 5 or 6 megapixels.- 400 ISO is adequate for 95% of my shooting, but sometimes I've wanted more film speed.All in all, the G2 does 95% of what the &quot;pro&quot; cameras do, and does lots of things the pro cameras don't do -- such as not being obtrusive, or too heavy to carry around. Weighing these pros and cons, I'd take my G2 over the &quot;pro&quot; SLRs.--Thomas David Kehoe, author of &quot;Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships&quot;	1
I have tried 6 of these so far and have yet to have success.  I have tried them on two different burners.  Have gone back to using standard DVD's instead.  Also, I complained to Amazon about the product and was not happy with the response.  They did offer to refund my money, but only if I returned all 10 discs.  Well, if I had known none of them were going to work I would have certainly saved them but instead tossed them when they failed.	0

Canon PowerShot G2 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical ZoomI bought the black Powershot G2, however the features on this triple-tone champagne beige colored case are the same.This is an amazing camera.  I've shot flower and jewelry closeups that compete favorably with higher megapixel models.  Clarity is exellent, ease of use very good.  This is a semi-pro model that would be a great choice for a beginner or a more advanced photographer.The zoom lens and auto-focus does an amazing job both outdoors in natural light or in a photo cube.Download is fast and simple, and there are a variety of formats supported.Comes with a re-chargeable lithium ion battery.A fully molded hand grip eliminates problems encountered with earlier models.  Featured is an extending 3x, F2.0 - F2.5 'Zoom Lens', evaluative center-weighted spot metering, 3 selectable focus areas and 10-bit RAW mode.  Comes with a 32MB compact flash card, but add a 2, 4 or 8GB card and you're good to go ... anywhere.Highly recommended.	1
I bought this product to interface to a microcomputer. The product claims to have drivers for Windows, and Mac OS X. I loaded the drivers for Mac OS X and subsequently after a reboot, the application could not find a serial device and an examination of /dev showed no pseudo device was created.Then I gave up and installed the drivers for Windows XP. Once I had done that, my machine began blue screening, which it had never previously done before.The bottom line is that I was unable to use the device on any available platform (I didn't try Linux). and my project stopped dead in it's tracks over this. I guess I will have to go dig out an old computer with a real serial port to do this work. That is pretty silly when I have a very expensive Mac Pro on my desk, and a MacBook Pro, neither of which can operate this device, either under leopard or snow leopard.Don't buy this product. I don't know how anyone is getting any satisfaction with it, but I certainly am not.	0

The Canon G2 gives amazing color.  Get a good canon printer like the i950 and you'll get amazing prints.  It does black and white very well and gives great bright colors in landscape photos.  My only real complaint is it's super slow.  I upgraded from the Toshiba M4 2.1 megapixel camera and I honestly wish that I'd kept it too.  The Toshiba, while three years older than the canon caught better candid shots. I find that when using my Canon I cannot capture good candids of people or animals, it's so slow that the subject moves before it records the scene.  Super slow.  It hesitates all of the time and the red eye flash alerts your subject that you are there, totally ruining the picture.  I'm either looking at buying a Canon 10D or buying back my old M4 for now.	1
This item is billed as a Serial-to-USB adapter, but  while it installed it does not even show up in my list of com ports and cannot initiate a connection to the serial device.It also came with no instructions and no CD of drivers. No website address. Nothing. Really poor.	0

It dies if you plug in any external USB disk drive or card reader.  D-Link just doesn't know how to write device drivers that work well.  I've had problems with every D-Link product I've ever bought.	0
This is the first digital camera I have purchased.  After reseaching the digital camera field for about 3 months, I decided on the Canon Powershoot G2.  I am extremely pleased with its performance.  I never thought a digital camera could rival a 35mm SLR camera, but the Canon excedes most if not all of the attributes of a photochromatic paper camera.  Though the camera is midsized, it is packed with so many features that it is perfect for those photographers who what the versatility of a full sized SLR but do not want to lug around a briefcase full of camera equipment.  Some of its standout features include a LCD screen that swings out like a camcorder and folds away with the screen towards the camera body, thus protecting it from the eventual scratch; and Compactflash II card compatibility enabling high image storage, which you will need with the camera set at its highest 4 megapixel resolution.  A 32MG Smartmedia card will not suffice with a 4.0 megapixel camera.You will not be disappointed with this camera.  I highly recommend it.	1
I bought this to connect my notebook to my DI-624 at 108Mbps.It worked well enough and I didn't have any of the driver installation issues other reviewers have mentioned.However the D-Link drivers interfere with the Intel wireless drivers on Centrino notebooks - my internal wireless card stopped working and after I got D-Link customer support to acknowledge there was a problem, the only solution they could offer was to re-install Windows. Thanks guys.Also, I've recently upgraded to a DI-634 router and I can no longer connect at 108Mbps if I have any kind of encryption turned on. This is probably a propblem with the router, but its worth knowing.	0

I first isntalled this to WinXP 2nd ED and all of a sudden I am getting blue screens and the system keeps rebooting over and over.  I uninstall and the problem goes away.  Coincidence?  I will let you decide.  I reinstalled the adaptor and it gets very very hot..  reminds me of my notebook that overheats and shuts down.  I cant get a connection to my router.  I have my notebook im typing on now connected right next to the adaptor desktop and get a signal just fine with my notebook.  I will be sending this back.	0
I've had my Canon Powershot G2 4MP Digital Camera for about 3 months now and I am completely in love.  This is my 3rd Digital Camera and I think I will be using this camera for years to come.  This camera package includes the beautiful 4.0 Mega-pixel Canon PowerShot G2 camera, 32MB CompactFlash card, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, AC Adapter, wireless remote control, neck strap, lens cap w/strap, USB cable, A/V cable along with software and manual.4 Megapixel settings on the camera allows you to take pictures that look just as a good as a traditional 35 mm high quality camera.  The camera can be set to 4 different resolutions with a maximum resolution of 2272 x 1704 and the minimum resolution of 640 x 480.  You can store the images captured in JPEG or RAW format, which is better than the traditional TIFF format.  Canon does include software that will allow you to convert the RAW format.The camera accepts both Type I and Type II CompactFlash memory cards. A 32MB card is included which will allow for about 10-15 pictures in the highest resolution setting.  I instantly sprang for a SanDisk 256 MB CompactFlash Card and the Sandisk Imagemate CompactFlash Card Reader (SDDR-31) to download the pictures from the card directly vs. using the camera's USB connector.  The camera is also microdrive compatible, but I haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.  The prices for 1 GB microdrives are around $300.00 which makes it a really attractive accessory for this camera.The 3x optical zoom lens gives you a 35mm equivalent focal length of 34 to 102mm.  Another thing I love about this camera is the tilt-and-swivel LCD that's included.  The LCD twits around completely that will allow you to take some of the over-the-head, backwards, impossible shots.  One of the best features about this camera is its battery consumption or the lack thereof.  I took over 200 pictures indoors with flash in one sitting and I still had plenty of juice left into the battery.  I could have shot for another 2 hours, but I ran out of CF cards.  The G2 also has a full TTL hot-shoe built onto the top of the camera to add another flash.  The bottom of the camera includes a tripod mount.The true camera geeks will be happy with all the possible exposure modes available on the camera.  Starting with the automatic exposure mode to complete granular control that the SLR provides, this camera will make everyone happy.  The scene exposure modes allow for presets to take portraits, pan-focus, landscape, and night-scene.  If you get this camera, you have to try to use the included Photo Stitch software to take those truly breathtaking panoramic pictures.In conclusion, this is a great camera that will give you years of great service and take fabulous pictures.  The only complaint I would have about this camera was the connectivity on my XP computer.  The camera includes a USB cable and software that is supposed to allow you to download the pictures from the camera directly, but I was getting some weird connectivity errors.  Since I already had the Sandisk CF card reader, I never tried to get this connectivity working.  But a lot of other people have this working and so this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.	1
OK. I take my words back. I found a solution to the connection problem with windows xp. Download a patch ( WindowsXP-KB884020-x86-enu.exe, solving WPA issues) from microsoft, then everything goes as it should be.-------------------------------------i bought this USB adapter along with DI-624 router for $99. The router works perfectly fine. The USB adapter gave me so much trouble. i used it to connect my desktop pc to wireless network. It works when the network is not encrpted. But it won't find an IP address under WPA security. It searches IP address endlessly. I have winxp sp2 which is supposed to support wireless flawlessly. I think either this so-called 108m bps or the driver causing the trouble. Having seen others having problem with other brands of USB adapter, i think maybe for desktop, a wireless pci card is better.	0
I've had my Canon Powershot G2 4MP Digital Camera for about 3 months now and I am completely in love.  This is my 3rd Digital Camera and I think I will be using this camera for years to come.  This camera package includes the beautiful 4.0 Mega-pixel Canon PowerShot G2 camera, 32MB CompactFlash card, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, AC Adapter, wireless remote control, neck strap, lens cap w/strap, USB cable, A/V cable along with software and manual.4 Megapixel settings on the camera allows you to take pictures that look just as a good as a traditional 35 mm high quality camera.  The camera can be set to 4 different resolutions with a maximum resolution of 2272 x 1704 and the minimum resolution of 640 x 480.  You can store the images captured in JPEG or RAW format, which is better than the traditional TIFF format.  Canon does include software that will allow you to convert the RAW format.The camera accepts both Type I and Type II CompactFlash memory cards. A 32MB card is included which will allow for about 10-15 pictures in the highest resolution setting.  I instantly sprang for a SanDisk 256 MB CompactFlash Card and the Sandisk Imagemate CompactFlash Card Reader (SDDR-31) to download the pictures from the card directly vs. using the camera's USB connector.  The camera is also microdrive compatible, but I haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.  The prices for 1 GB microdrives are around $300.00 which makes it a really attractive accessory for this camera.The 3x optical zoom lens gives you a 35mm equivalent focal length of 34 to 102mm.  Another thing I love about this camera is the tilt-and-swivel LCD that's included.  The LCD twits around completely that will allow you to take some of the over-the-head, backwards, impossible shots.  One of the best features about this camera is its battery consumption or the lack thereof.

Like some others, I've run into strange performance issues with this device, and it's the first DLINK product that I've been less than thrilled with.The largest problem is that the device loses connection when I'm burning CDs.  And when the wireless device is offline, nothing short of a full reboot will restore operation.  Unfortunately, sometimes it corrupts files on my C: drive, and XP will read the device as being bad hardware, and goes into a death spiral of checking the C: drive, failing, rebooting, trying to check the C: drive.  Only thing you can do at that point is unplug the Wireless Adapter and start over.  It's frustrating and I've given up on using the device.  I'll throw it in a drawer to use when I'm working on someone else's PC at home.	0
This is a fantastic little card.  I use it daily at home with a D-Link 614+ router and achieve the 22Mbps.  It has fantastic range.  There is no where in my 1600 square foot home that I can't get a signal, I can even surf the web in the front yard!  The beauty of this card is the ease of setup, especially with a D-Link router.  However, I have also used this card flawlessly and seamlessly with a Linksys router.There are only two minor problems I can see.  One is that it doesn't automatically jump to a default SSID.  You have to manually connect to it.  Therefore, if you're at home and connect to an SSID of "home" and then you bring it to work, you have to tell it to connect to the SSID "work", or else it will always try to find "home".  If you could enter a default SSID of "default" and have it jump to any available open SSID, that would make this card flawless.  However, it takes about 5 seconds to open the config utility and tell it to connect to the available network, so not a big deal.  It's just annoying for those of us that have to deal with very technologically challenged users calling us all of the time asking why it doesn't work.The second issue I have with this card is the rare occassion that you are in a situation where you have an office with several routers.  It will hang on for dear life to a router that it's connected to, even if you're closer to another router.  So, if you connect to a router, move downstairs and have a signal strength of 11%, even if you're standing right next to another router with 100% signal strength, it won't disconnect from the original router until it totally loses the connection.  Of course, once again, you can manually tell it to switch to the other router.  This is such a rare problem that you really only have in a office setting, so it doesn't affect my 5 star rating whatsoever.I've used it at home with a workgroup, at work with a domain, and at the mall for free Internet browsing.  All flawless.  Windows XP Pro treats it like a champ.  I highly recommend it to all of my clients and have purchased 4 of these myself!  As a bonus, it's cheaper than many of the 11mbps cards!  A+	1
This drive worked beutifully in the first 9 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before.	0

The speakers worked fine for about a year then began "popping". Now I have to fiddle with the volume control to get both speakers to work. This is not a quality item.	0
In reading the reviews here I was concerned about the performance of this card. The price was right so I purchased it. I'm glad I didn't worry about the other negative comments about this card (and the partner wireless router I purchased too - DLINK DI-713P - they work great together!).I've had this card installed about 4 weeks now. Installation was SIMPLE, just load the drivers off the CD and then stick the card in - EASY! The performance of the card has been great. I'm sitting outside on my patio typing this. I'm listening to MP3's stored on my main PC at the same time.I've been all over the yard checking signal strength, and yes, it does drop here and there, but never lost the signal (including the MP3 playback). My wireless router is upstairs (2nd floor) and on the other side of the house. Everyhing is working just fine. I don't know what others expect, but this card has met my expectations (and I'm usually hard to please).	1
When I first got these, they sounded great. Shortly after the one year warranty, I noticed that only one speaker was playing sometimes. I thought it was my imagination at first, because it seemed to alternate as to which speaker wouldn't be working. Also noticed the crackling any time you touch the knobs. I don't really use the volume knob since computers can adjust the sound, but the volume knob now appears to cause sound to alternate between the two speakers as you adjust the volume. When you stop turning the volume knob, you sometimes end up with stereo sound, but mostly just sound from one speaker. These still sound great when they work right, but Klipsch should be ashamed to have their name on these. I have some $10 computer speakers that have worked for fine for 7 or 8 years, you would think Klipsch could make some pretty high quality speakers for $100.	0

These sounded pretty good, and they lasted oh, about a week beyond the end of the warranty. Then they intermittently produced bursts of FULL VOLUME static and digital processor hash sound, seemingly whenever they wanted to. It didn't matter what volume we had them set ... even turned all the way down they'd burst forth and emit ear-piercing shrieks. The company was no help at all ... suggested we buy another pair to replace them. Imagine that ... so we bought a set of Logitechs and are very happy.	0
One of the coolest toys. Installed flawlessly (yes on XP) and I was connected to my D-Link 614+ router in minutes - you may not notice a speed improvement unless your access point is also capable of 22Mbps.  You should also check that your registry TCP/IP value are sufficient to make use of the increased bandwidth e.g. TCPWindowSize under XP.Really fast and reliable. Use the driver on install CD or d/l the latest from their site.  I've hit on a few glitches with intermediate releases.  D-Link support is nothing to write home about.But then again the card works great.	1
I bought these on special, and they are just TERRIBLE. Murky sound, things I am so used to hearing in my music are just GONE. Bass is nothing to write home about. The whole sound platform is just muddy. No clarity or precision at all. Especially at low volumes, you'd think you were holding a pillow over the speakers. Unfortunately I can't return these because they were sitting in the box for a month while I was OS.	0

March 2008 UPDATE: Speakers ceased working. $100 speakers should last longer than 15 months! I will not buy Klipsch products again.For their size and price these speakers deliver impressive sound and are attractive as well. However, Klipsch puts a cheap volume control potentiometer in these units resulting in loud static and sound cut-out when the knob is turned. This started to be a minor nuisance about a year after purchase but has now become a major nuisance. Often no sound comes out of the left speaker until the volume knob is vigorously jiggled and then it is usually at only a low volume. (Also, a foot came off one of the speakers soon after purchase but was easily glued back on).	0
This card is great when it works (once you get the drivers and firmware up to date, anyway), but seems to be prone to problems. I bought two of these cards originally, for two different laptops (one a Gateway, the other an IBM, both running Windows XP). All of a sudden, one laptop started rebooting spontaneously sometimes, then sometimes locking as Windows XP restarted, and sometimes it wouldn't turn back on at all. I was baffled by it until in desperation I tried popping the card out, and all of a sudden no more problems. I swapped the card with the other one and the exact same problems migrated to the other laptop. I called D-Link and they cross-shipped a replacement card (though it took most of a month to get it), which worked fine for a month and now seems to be causing the same problems again. I won't be buying another one of these.	1
Individuals looking for a small desktop speaker (for laptops or workstations) will find these speakers to suit their needs.  The audio is fairly rich for such a compact form factor; bass does not drown out the mids or highs, and the highs do not pierce your eardrums.However, in my opinion, these speakers have a lot of issues which should have been thought of before being released on the market.1) External AC power adapter -- the size of a large baseball, although square (not rectangular) in shape.  It's huge, weighs a lot, and gets quite hot.  It's one of those "inline" power bricks, where it sits between the AC outlet and the speakers themselves.  Anyone familiar with these power bricks knows how irritating they can be when it comes to finding a place to put them.  I prefer the AC adapter be put inside the speaker enclosure.2) Speaker hiss -- this is a well-known problem with most Klipsch speakers released sometime after the 2nd revision of the ProMedia 2.1 series.  The speakers, when turned on at lowest volume (and without anything plugged into them as an input device), emit a very loud hissing noise.  This haunts the GMX series as well.  The problem is caused by Klipsch increasing the internal gain (amplification) of the speakers (thus making them louder).  Since there's no way to adjust the gain, you end up with speakers requiring you to turn them completely off when not in use.  Otherwise, white noise constantly bombards your ears.3) Faulty adjustment dials -- another well-known problem with Klipsch multimedia speakers since (and including) the ProMedia 2.1 days.  Klipsch has once again decided to use a very cheap brand of potentiometre for their bass and volume adjustment knobs.  The problem with these pots is that over time/use, dust manages to get inside of the pot.  When this happens, you'll hear static coming out of the speakers every time you adjust the volume or adjust the bass.  As stated, the ProMedia 2.1 control pod suffers from this problem too.  Why Klipsch keeps using the same crummy pots for their products is anyone's guess.If you think my complaints are limited to just one person (me), I urge you to visit the Klipsch Forums and see for yourself.  Look at the ProMedia 2.1 forum as well, because they use the same pots as these speakers.Because of these three (what I consider to be major) flaws, I can't give this product more than 2 stars.  I will admit that the audio quality is quite good for small form-factor speakers (compared to the Creative Itrigue series, for example), but the negatives easily outweigh the positives.If you want a good set of semi-small speakers, but require the use of a humongous heat-emitting subwoofer, and insist that they must be Klipsch, get the ProMedia 2.1 set (which do not suffer from the hiss problem).  Otherwise, consider a different manufacturer.	0

I purchased these speakers for my wife's computer.  She (among other things) teaches music, and sometimes will use her computer as a teaching aid for her students.  Her studio is about 35'x25', and as such the sound from most 2.0 speaker systems was inadequate.Right out of the box there were problems.  Most significant was a constant, persistent, and loud high pitched squeal.  Following the troubleshooter's guide in the provided instructions found some relief with adjusting the sound settings on the computer, but in order to do so required most settings to be on mute or just above, preventing the computer from producing *any* sound.  Use of a third party sound equalizer for the computer allowed some sound to once again be used, but it seems that such measures should not be necessary (out of the five other speaker sets I've used with this computer, it was never needed prior to these speakers).Once a work-around for the problem was found, I tried several types of music and audio files to get an idea on how well they worked.  They did very well for pop/rock/metal and the like, clear with good bass for a 2.0 system.  They also did well with standard Windows sounds and with sound effects from computer games.  However, they were totally inappropriate for classical and opera, solo piano pieces in particular, and sounded rather mute and lacking depth and richness.  This was quite disappointing as my wife predominantly teaches classical piano, and I had purchased these speakers to help her with her business.  I'm still on the hunt for a good set of 2.0 speakers for a reasonable price, so if you have any suggestions or complaints, please feel free to use the comments section at the end of this review.	0
I now have an old laptop at home with a D-Link card that serves as nothing more than a portable browser and connected the hub to my cable modem. I am amazed at how often we use this thing in front of the TV to look up listings, do some shopping (from Amazon.com of course!), check e-mail, settle a trivia dispute, pay bills, etc.  No dial-up delays and being able to use it throughout the house without wires is wonderful.  I consider wireless Internet access on par with indoor plumbing in terms of convenience.The D-link was easy to set-up and has worked flawlessly for about months now.	1
Just adding my voice to the others before me.  The sound of these speakers is outstanding for the price, but the quality is abysmal.  I, like so many others, found that these speakers inevitably go down hill over time.  The volume and bass controls get noisy.  The scratchiness gets progressively worse until the left channel quits working all together.  You can fix the problem by taking the speaker apart and cleaning the control, but the problem soon returns.  The connections on the back go bad as well.  If you read the forums on the Klipsh website you see the same story over and over.Mine went in the trash.  I feel like I wasted $100 and the land fill just got a little deeper.  I hate the waste of it.  I gladly would have paid $150 dollars for the same speaker built to last.  When I replace my home theatre speakers, guess which brand I won't consider.People who write reviews about these speakers while new love them.  Reviewers who've had them 6 months or more have a different story.  Beware.	0

Bought these in Feb 2008 for the wife.  Great sound, small profile, then after a few months (about 1 week of actual playing time) they went dead.the seller, AB Electronics will not respond to e-mails.  Bought a LogitechX-140 2.0 Speaker system for 1/2 the price and they work better.	0
This card is very easy to set up. It has decent speed so much so that I can listen to web radio on my laptop without a problem. Range wise, I have no basis of comparison. I live in a big 2 bedroom apartment, and signal is at it's max everywhere I go in the apartment, in the balcony, all through concrete walls.Application coming with it let you tell how good the signal strength and link is.The only complaint I might have is that I suspect the driver eats up considerable amount of memory, thus slowing down my laptop which has a mere 64 MB or ram.nevertheless, it's a very good product IMO	1
The sound quality is a plus. Having a bass control knob is a plus. The volume and bass knobs are hard to turn - a slight negative, but not a big deal. The weight of the speakers are also a slight negative. The worst part about the speakers was the flimsy AC adapter connection in the back. The hole in the back is not deep enough so the slightest movement of the speakers or the AC adapter, disconnects the power to the speakers. If you nudge the speaker while adjusting the volume or try to reposition the speaker, the power disconnects. I got so irritated that I used these speakers one day and exchanged them for Bose Companion 2 - because they were the same price. I suppose you could find good speakers that are less expensive than these, but for the most part (exceptions are noted) there's a slight correlation between price and quality. Please read my review on Bose Companion 2.	0

Installation of the DWL-650+ is a breeze. D-Link's install process and software is better than some I've seen. And certainly it's high-speed performance (when matched with a compatible WAP) is a benefit, and a cheaper option than other, faster wireless standards.I have used the card for a couple of months, and find two primary annoyances:1. The configuration software for the DWL-650+ doesn't support passphrase entry of the WEP encryption strings as some other wireless cards do, forcing you to type-in the strings.  And type you do... Since the software doesn't allow you to paste from the clipboard (perhaps you keep your WEP strings in a text file -- if you do, it'll do you no good with the DWL-650+). (I should note that if you allow Windows XP to manage your wireless connections, this is a non-issue, since you can paste into the Windows configuration dialogs.)2. For some reason, PPTP VPNs do not work through this card, at least with Windows XP.  I've tested it in two different laptops, and the results are the same... Attempts to use the remote network over a PPTP connection with the DWL-650+ simply fail for no particular reason. Switch to a different brand of card, same WAP, same VPN configuration, same laptop -- and things are fine. (I've read other reports of this type online as well, so I don't think it's just me.)All that said, I do like the native configuration software's ability to sniff out available networks (though once again, Windows XP can do this itself as well, but the native software does it better). And the card does seem to capture and hold signal to the WAP quite nicely, and better than other brands I've tried.So for basic use, the card is fine, and would probably satisfy most users.	1
If the support phone line is busy, you don't even get put on hold. You get a message to call back and it drops the call. The email support can take weeks. You get one little hint at a time. I will NEVER buy their product again. NEVER!	0

Despite the "Tech Specs" of Amazon, the WD NetCenter does not support RAID 1 (mirroring) configuration.  According to a Western Digital representative in their forums, "RAID functionality was tested with this device but was not implemented on the final product due to lack of interest from our beta testers. This feature may be implemented on future enterprise based external products, but will not be implemented on the NetCenter hard drive."	0
This is a simply a great card.  Setup was a breeze- just follow the 2 steps in the quick start guide: install the software first, and THEN insert the card.  That was all there was to it- WinXP (Pro, SP1) did the rest.  The card has been working great ever since, no issues with it at all; speeds have been fantastic, ~500 KB/sec.  My first experience with D-Link has been a great one.  You just can't beat the value of this card, I got mine for 50 dollars after rebate.	1
Probably better off spending a couple more bucks to get one better put together.  It is simply cheap plastic with poor soldering on the board.  When it did work, it was ok.	0

So i used this for a week or two to connect the high level subwoofer output of my receiver to my amp powering my custom built subwoofer and at extremely low and loud volumes i noticed a clipping issue and I tracked it down to this device.I ended up just building a custom solution using cut off RCA plugs, 68K Ohm resisters and speaker wire.I read another review on another high low converter and found that the guy who wrote the review tracked down the transformer inside of that model and it had a terrible frequency response. I understand the need for DC isolation (i think that is what caused the clipping at 19Hz) but I think in the car audio world it may be more of a need than in the home. I would not buy a high low converter ever again. I will just build one with a resister.here are the pics of what I built (post #11)[...]	0
No problems at all installing and configuring.  The enclosed documentation and software are straightforward and easy to use.  The signal with my D-Link router was strong and good quality throughout my entire house and yard.  Signal strength dropped off a bit at the extreme edges but this did not translate into any detectable slowdowns.	1
Let me preface this review with the fact that the unit I purchased was refurbished, but I'm not sure whether that had anything to do with the fact that it was a piece of junk from the getgo.  It took multiple times of plugging and unplugging the antenna, passport and power cord to get the player (or dock) to recognize any of it.  Then once I went through all that rigamarole, it would sit on a loading screen for 10 minutes before it would even pick up a signal.  My signal strength was 3 bars, by the way, so low signal strength should not have been an issue.  And just to give the player a chance, I moved the whole set-up to different areas of my home to see if that improved the loading issue - it didn't.In both Live XM and record modes, the player would drop the first 5 seconds of audio during every, single song.  After 10 minutes of listening to music, it would go back to the Loading screen for another 10 minutes.  Meaning that less than 50% of the time I was getting audio.So after struggling with all of that for a day, I upgraded the firmware and proceeded to try the player again.  It had all of the exact same issues.After several days of fighting with the Nexus, I was more than ready for it to go back to the seller, which is exactly where it wound up (although the trash would've also been a suitable place for it.)I purchased this to replace a Pioneer Inno.  The Nexus is definitely not a replacement for the Inno.	0

The player has what to me is a fatal flaw: when playing back recorded XM content, the player creates an automatic couple of seconds of silence between every song. This break is even more annoying because it seems to not be an inserted space (a couple of seconds of dead air if you will) added between tracks, but rather is done ON TOP of the recording. In other words, the last few notes of every single song and the first few notes of the next song get cut off always. This is more jarring than you would imagine, especially since like most radio stations, XM's songs play back-to-back (ie: the next song is played on the station as the previous song fades away). This is the normal continuous music mix we expect from normal radio listening but the player adds a very noticeable break that cuts off the songs on both ends. This is actually even worse a problem during spoken moments like the station IDs or announcements. In other words, instead of hearing "This is Fred on 44", the player will instead play "is is Fred on fo" cutting off the message. Another example is instead of playing the well-known jingle "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem", you only hear "rican Top 40 with Casey K". It is just ridiculous and ruins the entire listening experience. There seems to be no way around this flaw either. It might be less of a problem for listeners of classical or other programming that normally has silence in between each song, but for those who listen to pop or rock or dance radio, this is really terrible, as bad as if a DJ totally messes up the transition between songs on the dancefloor- what we like to call a "trainwreck" of music.	0
This is a good wireless card, with a couple of plusses and minuses:Minuses:A) It's 802.11b w/ a proprietary 22mbps mode, not 802.11g -- don't be fooled by the higher speed.B) It uses a proprietary Texas Instruments chipset that is incompatible with LinuxC) To get the 22mbps, you have to use all D-Link Airplus equipment (or equipment by the very small number of other manufacturers who use the same TI chipset)Pluses:A) At least when I got it, it was quite inexpensive.B) The drivers are stable and the management applet was easy to useC) If you do get all TI-based equipment, you get noticeably better performance than a standard 11mbps 802.11b systemFinal verdict: If you can, buy 802.11g equipment, not 802.11b.	1
Cons:1. Unit freezes, requiring hard reset every so often.2. After a album ends, it does not play the next album.3. Play all plays songs by alphabetical order of their titles.  This makes it useless for audio books.4. No Eastern languages support.Pros:1. Decent audio quality.  Some buzzing is heard, but not too noticable.2. Decent battery life.	0

Ok, I bought this thing a bit more than 2 weeks ago....and for about 1 week, it worked just great (see "positive" reviews).  Then,  I wasn't able to add anymore songs to it.  It loaded up into the player thru the computer and showed up in the drive when plugged in but didnt show up on the songs/albums list.  Its like the song disappeared or was hidden somewhere.So I took it back to the Best Buy where I bought it and the nice clerk told me that she ALWAYS saw this player returned (out of all the mp3 players).  She kindly told me this after I told her I wanted to exchange it for the same player.  I took her advice and took store credit cus I didnt think she'd lie for no reason.SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  They may have some kinks to work out.  I suggest either buying something else now and trying some later models of this.  Sandisk may have rushed this to get it out into stores.	0
It a good piece. Only thing I did not like is the card peeping out. I have to be careful when I keep inside the carrying case.Otherwise I love the concept of getting rid of the messy LAN cables and you can carry your internet connection when you move from one room to another.	1
This mp3 player works great, BUT! I purchased two of these units for my daughters. They work great and hold more music than an average person could listen to in a month. The problem is that Sansa offers no accessories for them. You can't get a car or wall adapter to charge the unit. There are NO cases available that will fit properly. The plugs on Sansa products are NOT the same as Sony's, so don't waste your money trying. If you are not constantly near a computer with a USB port, you cannot recharge the battery. Because my daughters carry them in their purse and no cases are available, they get all scratched up. Until Sansa gets their act together, I would not buy any of their products. I even called them, whereas I was told accessories would be out by Christmas (2006). Here it is April of '07 and still no accessories. Most stores are now refusing to even carry this product. Bad, Very Bad company support.	0

I sent the unit back after trying for a week to get it working, including downloading and reinstalling the software several times. A real waste of my time. I later ended up ordering a Cowan D2, which worked fine right out of the box. What a difference! I'd rate it 0 stars, but the system won't accept that.	0
Purchased this card to compliment the DI-614+ wireless router I purchased.  Installed this into my HP N5495 PIII laptop (1.06Ghz, 512 MB, Win XP Home) with out any problems at all.  Installed drivers as instructed, installed card and it was instantly recognized and windows finished the new adapter installation.  As soon as the install finished I was connected.  I have heard people having problems installing these D-Link cards without first disabling other network adapters but my computer has two others that are enabled and they cause no problems.  I installed my router in the corner of my basement and can roam to the opposite end of our 3 bedroom brick ranch home with no worse than 55% signal strength.  My Roadrunner service is providing 275-325 Kbps consistantly on this card almost everywhere in the house.  I've had great luck with the card and got a great deal on it.  I have also used 3 other D-link products and have nothing but easy installations with good working products.	1
I am going to skip telling how great this player at playing mp3, as even a $10 can play mp3 well.  I will just point out the cons as it might be very important to some people.1. Can't display chinese characters.  You can change the language setting of this mp3, and the menu will be displayed in the selected language.  I then downloaded some Chinese podcast to it and it showed chinese characters as "?".2. Does use a standard usb cable (not a big problem).  I have a GPS in my car and it would use standard USB cable for charging.  So you would either have to buy another cable to use in your car or carry the same cable around.3. You can't scroll menus while it is charging so you can't listen while you are charging.4. Worst of all, I am trying to get it to do podcast, it doesn't not have indicator to display new (never listened) mp3s. So pretty much, I'll need to go to each podcast folder to figure out which mp3 I have not listened. If you are really into listening to podcast, I don't think this is for you. I am using mypodder, and you will need to deleted listened podcast yourself. Unlike iPod where you can set to delete listened mp3 at sync time.5. Uses it's own video format, so you would pretty much have to convert every video before viewing.6. Relatively bigger and heavier than iPod nano and the screen isn't bigger than ipod nano 3rd gen.Pro:1. Cheap, I got it for $332. Can play mp3 if this is all you are asking for.	0

I bought this little MP3 player and returned it when it messed up my computer.  I bought an iPod Nano and now I'm happy	0
We received this item around Nov. 2003. The initial setup was problematic, and afterwords it worked some of the time, but mostly it would lock up the laptop. After several calls and emails to tech support, they finally acknowledged that the problem might be with the card and not with the laptop. They sent us a replacement card, and issued an RMA for the original card, which we had to pay to ship to them. The replacement card that they sent works fine, no crashes at all in the last two weeks. Very disappointed with their tech support.	1
Mine was dead within 5 minute of being attached to the computer after charging. The screen turned blue and the seller wanted to have it checked. I just wanted a refund. Not another product who which should have been checked when it was mailed to me.It was purchased for a kid who did not need a big multi gig for xmas.I would not accept this player free if reconditioned and DOA.It could be a good product I'll never know as it's not heavy enough to use as a paper weight.Remember never not buy electronics from a barn.Miatab	0

It's sleek, glitzy, beautiful, with great sound... but that's for people who just want music.I'm a pod-cast listener. I like to download the news and other programs (mostly NPR and BBC) so that I can listen while I'm on the run, commuting, shopping, and so on.What I need is something very easy to use and operate by tactile control,  so that I don't have to take my eyes off the road or anything else.  I'm still using a battered old Zen Nano that's literally held together by scotch tape because (1) its controls for cueing, skipping, deleting and all other forms of navigating, are performed by a sort of "joy stick" that I can feel and operate without looking, and (2) it comes in a case that clips to my belt.This product has neither. I bought this in the hope that I could finally retire my battered old Zen. No such luck. This item, gorgeous as it is, will probably spend the rest of its life in some drawer... or until I can find a teenager to give it to.This is the first device I've had in a long time for which I actually had to read the entire (41-page) manual before I could use it proficiently, and I take that as a very bad sign because I can't remember the last device I ever bought that required more than a cursory glance at the instructions, if any, to use it effectively. Several deficiencies were so glaringly bad that I had to see it for myself in print, such as the fact that you can't delete a track without hooking it up to a computer and deleting it from there.Aside from the podcast-related issues, there are aspects of its ergonomics that really need improving, like menu navigation and better button design.PS - Can anyone suggest a good replacement for my Zen that has the features I need? I bought the Zen Muvo, but its plug-in USB interface and slower transfer speeds are not friendly to my setup at home. If you send your advice to mattgb1 at gmail dot com, I'd appreciate it.	0
One of the niceties of attending a technologically savvy university is wireless surfing of the Internet; you bring the laptop and the wireless adapter, they'll supply the Access Point and on-ramp to the Net.  Wireless technology has been moving at a rather rapid pace of late.  What once was the doldrums of 11 Megabytes per second (Mps) has now catapulted up to 22.5Mps, then 55Mps, and coming soon, 100Mps and beyond with the introduction of the 802.11g standard coming electronics store near you later this year.So, when it came time for me to purchase a new wireless adapter for my Toshiba Satellite 1905 Notebook, I had an urge to jettison the past and move headlong into the future.  In other words I wanted a wireless adapter capable of transmitting and receiving at 22.5 Mps or more.Cisco Systems was one the first companies to break into the wireless networking arena in the mid-1990's, and has been selling wireless solutions to Corporate America for quite some time now.  The companies Aironet line of wireless products are a staple in the industry because they are reliable, durable, and work as advertised.  But, they have been traditionally expensive cards to get into, and that still holds true, so I shopped around for an inexpensive alternative.  I chose the DWL 650+ Wireless Adapters by D-Link.  I bought this card for two reasons; 1. conformity with the current 802.11b standard and; 2. the ability of the card to communicate at 22.5Mbs with other D-Link access points and or network cards (NIC).  Of course it helped that the card was on sell at the local Best Buy.Like the Linksys Instant Wireless WPC11, (see my review on this card at: [...] and the Aironet Wireless Ethernet Adapter PC4800B (see my review on this card at [...] the DWL 650+Wireless Adapter is a fully functional Ethernet NIC that conforms to the 802.11b standards for performance and in interoperability with other 802.11b wireless equipment.  The card operates at a frequency of 2.4Ghz, and utilizes the same protocols as wired Ethernet adapters; i.e. TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, Microsofts' NetBEUI, etc.The D-Link DWL 650+Wireless Adapter is a standard Type II PC Card form factor.  The box includes the card and a CD-ROM which is used to installed drivers for Windows 95/98/SE/Me/2000.  The included drivers for Windows XP are not signed by Microsoft and that might pose a problem depending on the make and model of your motherboard.  I had no problem installing the software on my Windows XP Home laptop.  As soon as I configured the card with the parameters of my wireless network I was able to communicate with the rest of the computers on my Windows 2000 Domain.  Note: Windows XP Home Ed. does not include native support for wireless adapters; i.e. automatic detection of different wireless networks and access points, however Window XP Professional does include such support.I was able to connect to my home network at 11 Mbs, on some occasions, and 5.5 to 2 Mbs on others.  The card is capable of automatically downgrading its data transfer rate as the signal from the access point becomes weaker, thus maintaining connection.  A handy signal strength bar in the system tray relays to me how strong, or weak my signal is.  When at the extreme range of the access point the card downgrade as far as 2Mps, which is still with acceptable limits for surfing the web and working on Word documents, but little else.  The D-Link DWL 650+Wireless Adapter is capable of transmitting and receiving at the following transfer rates: 1, 2, 5.5, 11, and 22 Mbps Transfer Rate.Under real-world conditions, the D-Link DWL 650+Wireless Adapter's performance meets or exceeds my expectations.  I have taken my notebook around the house and out to the back porch (my access point is in an upstairs bedroom closet), and never once lost a signal.  The signal faded somewhat on the back porch, but that is to be expected; surfing the web was never compromised.At school I have experience mixed results.  Connection to the schools wireless network has been spotty, but I attribute this more to the placement of the access points, then to the card performance.  Other students have experienced the same results as I have.Conclusion:The D-Link DWL 650+Wireless Adapter is a reliable middle of the pact wireless NIC.  I am not disappointed by its performance, nor am I overwhelmed, by it, just pleased.  If you need a wireless NIC that will meet your needs for current 802.11b standards, but still has the flexibility to expand beyond to 22.5Mbs, then the D-Link DWL 650 Wireless Adapter might be the cup of tea you're looking for.	1
ThisSanDisk Sansa MP3 Player with microSD Expansion Slot (Black)came to me as a gift, and was much appreciated, but it's not my favorite player. I use many other SanDisk products, which may be why I expected better performance.The positives are plenty: sharp image screen, ease of navigation, compact size, and a microdisk slot for expansion. I add music, videos and pictures by loading a microdisk because tansfering these files is far easier to deal with than using the SanDisk software that came with the device (which is supposed to allow drag-n-drop, though this hasn't worked for me).The negatives are a nuisance: sometimes the player just won't turn off, so I must let the battery run down entirely (that took over 24-hours in one occaision). Recharging the built-in battery takes up precious time and one of the limited USB slots on my laptop. While the navigation wheel makes it quicker to switch between functions, it is a nuisance when shoved in a pocket when I'm on the move because any friction seems to change programs or increase volume when least expected.It's a fine tool for displaying pictures and videos, and the voice notes do come in handy from time to time. The music player itself is good, but the built in equalizer doesn't make much difference in sound quality, at least to my ear. The fat ear buds that came with the Sansa are far too big for my petite ears, so are useless to me. Worst of all, it will not play audio certain files, and I adore books on tape from Audible.My far less expensive RCA MP3 player recognizes a broader range of files, and runs about 10 hours on one rechageable AAA battery, so gets loads more use.	0

After 5 days this MP3 player whent Tango Uniform. List of issues:1. Songs became corrupted one by one.2. Screen changed to a very hard to see green/yellow combination.3. Audio became intermittent. Then a lot of static started showing up in high notes.4. Would freeze for long periods of time.For 5 days it worked great then the symptoms started manifesting themselves. I am returning it to amazon and will probably by a Nano in its place.I usually dont have any problems with electronics items I purchase, perhaps luck has always been on my side. Not this time.The promise of a larger screen in color, FM radio & icon menus instead of text didnt hold their promise. Sorry, Sandisk but you failed with this MP3 player.	0
I'd tried earlier generation wireless networking, and ended up with little success and many sleepless nights.The DWL-650+ worked well. Within 20 minutes of opening its box and the D-Link wireless router, I was up and running, communicating with machines on my wired network.	1
the important information: wmp 11 worked best with this. plays for sure is only on the rhapsody model. update the firmware before you do anything else. converting videos (amazon unbox) never worked - big nightmare! managed to convert one video using 3rd party software - worked! the unit was very buggy and firmware update didn't fix that. controls were loose, the unit had a mind of its own and off and on it was not recognized by my computer.if you want something mainly for music and your own videos (and you didn't mind gambling), this might be a good player. from the reviews i see that the buggy ones are a smaller percentage. i would not buy another one of these - i am a tinker, and i couldn't make it work. far easier to program a vcr. the two stars were because it really is a thing of beauty.i am very sad to return it - it was just the right size, the screen is a thing of beauty, and it didn't come with a bazillion dongles. however, after struggling with it for the past day and a half, it just isn't worth it.btw - customer service on their site was great - detailed answer to my question with options to troubleshoot - within a couple of hours!	0

I purchased this product and had to return it shortly after, because it stopped working. The one I received worked for a few weeks and then also stopped working. The screen froze up like the first one. Don't buy this product it is nothing but problems. The unit is Made In China, which is a problem in its self.	0
I'm using my DWL-650+ with my windows XP laptop and have experienced no problems with it. Works like a charm, really. Strong reception, and easy to use. My only complaint is that once connected it's sometimes difficult to disconnect from a network, which means if you get on the wrong one it can be a little annoying to get back on the right one..	1
I have this model for almost a year. I expected to us eit for video play or image slide play. But I just can't get it right for most of occasion. Now I almost foot I still have this e250 until I saw the page from here so I think I need to share part of my experience.I don't sign up for any online music service. Only use media player to transfer music from my library and collection. For many times I have difficult to transfer the right songs to right location in this e250. I feel there are many bugs issues in this model. So I gave up and go get ipod to get the better life. For sound quality I may give it 3 stars but for ease of use I will give it 1 star. The conclusion, the quality at sound can't even compare with the digital voice recorder "OLYMPUS ws-300m". How sad!!	0

I was disappointed in this product. I attend day long meetings several times a year and wanted a device that would record a series of sessions. The device only records in two hour or so increments. Additionally the battery ran out after several hours. So for short recordings, it works okay. But if you need it to record additional information, be sure to get the car charger (or find an outlet) so that you can record all day. Lastly, it was not that easy to figure out how to use. The instructions that came with the device were minimal. It took awhile, but I finally figure out how to use by trial and error.	0
I'm not an avid photographer, but I do like my photos to resemble the colors and shapes that they are in real life, which was not happening with my old Kodak Easyshare. It sufficed for photographing things to sell on Ebay and/or Craigslist, but not much more.I received the Olympus C-50 as a hand-me-down from my aunt, who wanted to upgrade. She used the camera for a trip to Italy (and is the very definition of enthusiastic P&S; photographer), and it took gorgeous photos so I had high hopes.It does take very nice pictures. I wouldn't know a chromatic aberration unless it was pointed to me, but the colors and shapes are true. You can play with the exposure time, which is nice. Flash is a must when taking indoor shots, and it can overexpose in this way. You also have to use the LCD over the viewfinder, because it's the only way to ensure the focus is correct. But for the most part, I'm very pleased with the photos.What is making me want to upgrade is the on/off mechanism, as well as its speed (or lack thereof). I have promised myself never to buy a camera with a sliding door as the power switch, because it has been spontaneously shutting itself off even if I'm very careful in not touching it. Also, it takes about 30 seconds to fully start up, from the moment the door opens to when you can actually take a picture. Probably okay if you're taking pictures of things that don't move, but definitely not a camera you want to take to the zoo, or a party.Also, the flap that covers the USB port is a flimsy sort of rubber, and was open and flapping away when I got it from my aunt. Same with the power port.To conclude, it takes nice pictures, but is so slow it probably doesn't suit most people's needs.	1
I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported.  However, the video clip capability is TERRIBLE.They list a variety of supported clip formats.  THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device.  Everything must be convertged.  This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files.  Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings.  Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly.  It will not work.You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.1.  You are supposed to be able to import VOBs.  WRONG.  It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone.  There is no way around this bug.2.  You have absolutely no control over compression settings.  If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate.  The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.3.  If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these.  There is no way to avoid this.  If you try to join the files, they will not play.4.  The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.5.  The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.This is really a nifty player.However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future.  You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk.  If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.July 11 2006One individual reports that Sandisk will supply a replacement USB.I have found no source for the hyped battery replacement.	0

So disappointed with this. The player crashed on the second day.First day: everything ok and easy to transfer songs / video clip from my pc to the player. Just drag & drop.Second day: When I connect the player to my pc, it did not read anything. Same thing with my other pc & laptop. Still no connection.Third day: tried again to connect still unsuccesful.Fourth day: Returned to Amazon.	0
Everybody's right with their list of pros and cons...but here's the thing...if we all wanted all those extra features we would've bought a different model! Why is this camera good? Small size, great resolution, point & shoot, good battery life, resitant to cold (i dropped it in the snow and it's fine).I practically take it everywhere and it's still alive. I've had it for almost 4 years, and even though there're other great cameras in the market..i know it still competes, cos its got great features in such a small package. But if you want something more professional, this is not a camera for you. I hope my review is helpful for you!!! =)	1
I have had two of these drives fail. Neither had more than 30 hours of use. In fact I barely had all my applications installed. What was really nice was finding out the second one failed the morning of April 15 when I was attempting to boot up and submit my tax return.Very disappointing. They'll send me another drive but I'll not be installing my operating system or any critical files on it. Just too unreliabe. In fact I don't even know what I'm going to do with it. Seems silly to have a backup drive you have to backup onto another drive.I don't do any gaming or use any apps that place high demand on the hard drive. In fact the computer hasn't even been plugged in for three months. I used to like Seagate but they have lost a customer for life. When two units fail like this in less than 80 hours total use I believe its a pretty good indication of how good the product is.I should have listened to the reviewers before buying. But in the old days I had a Seagate last ten years without fail so my judgment was clouded. Clearly quality is a thing of the past with Seagate. These drives effectively wasted 30+ hours of my life.Buy this drive if you like to talk to people in India otherwise try another vendor.	0

I bought thru amazon this Seagate ST3500641A-RK 500Gb drive, but less than a week after I installed it in my winXp pro system, it crashed the system during a simple drive to drive copy procedure.  Concerned, I ran a disk utility program, HDDlifePro-2.9.105, and the health and performance were rated at 47%. Speedfan, another HD health check program, confirmed these readings via an online evaluation.  While the drive is still reported as healthy, it is not yet a month old, and I have many other disks several years old at 90% or over health and performance ratings.  Health later rose to 51% but how can a BRAND NEW DRIVE fall to HALF its health nearly out of the box?I contacted Seagate support, and a reply took weeks, asking me to run again their mediocre utitility scan, which merely reports it as healthy without percentile numbers, and they labeled the issue as SOLVED.  Great for them.I had copied 350gb of data to this disk, so I am loath to return it, specially since they may say that 51% is still healthy and I should accept it at that.  But really, this is the second Seagate drive that has given me problems, while drives for Western Digital and other brands always performed fine.  So Seagate may have the hype but not the delivery.  I will never buy from the again.J. Rapalo	0
Having been a serious amateur photographer for years, I was very skeptical that a small snapshot size camera could effectively compete with film.  I am converted.I took some well lit test shots then sent them off to get printed at 8 by 10 on photographic paper (via ofoto.com).  I was blown away.  These vibrant 8 by 10's have all the accuity and impact of 35mm film. This is not true of a 3.2 megapixel camera we own.  It cannot produce professional quality 8 by 10's.  But the 5 megapixel C-50 can.At nearly $... you had better plan on more than snapshots.  Any of the $... cameras can serve that role.  But if you plan on doing serious photography - easily and well, this little camera is your choice.	1
I got this product to switch between my laptop and desktop PCs, both running Windows 7.At first it seemed to work, but there was always a short delay when I switched from one PC to the other, and the mouse pointer "stuttered" for several seconds until it behaved normally.Then weird things started happening. I'd switch from the laptop to the desktop, and the keyboard and mouse wouldn't come on. I had to switch back and forth a few times to make them work.Then I'd put my desktop PC into Sleep mode and switch to the laptop---and the desktop would spontaneously "wake up" again.Then my desktop PC started crashing. I couldn't boot Windows---the PC crashed and restarted as soon as it reached the logon screen.I removed the Belkin KVM switch and connected everything directly to the desktop PC---and the problems vanished.I spent a week corresponding with Belkin's tech support. They told me to update my video card driver, be sure I had all Windows updates installed, etc.---which I'd done long before contacting them.  :?|  Then they had me fiddling around in Device Manager, changing USB settings... They wouldn't even consider that the KVM switch might be the problem.I finally gave up and bought another manufacturer's product that cost slightly more. It has worked perfectly. Switching PCs is completely smooth, with no delay or flakiness at all, and I haven't had a single crash. It's like night and day.I'm afraid this just isn't a very good product. If you think you're going to buy it, be sure you can return it.	0

After spending days and days surfing the internet and reading review after review, some good and some not so good regarding this camera, I went forward with the purchasing of one about three months ago.  All hesitation and concern has since subsided and I have to say that this camera is really quite excellent.  Is there a learning curve?  Sure.  However that is NOT to say that the 'auto' feature is insufficient and won't take great shots.  What it does mean is that with a few minutes of investigation and time, you can work with all of the many different settings (that I've not seen on other similarly priced cameras) and take even better pictures.I came to this Olympus from a Fuji (2 MP - Finepix 2400 zoom) and I always thought that my Fuji took brilliant pictures and that it couldn't be beat.  Boy was I wrong.  I can't say enough about the differences.  My Fuji was a great camera, however whenever I take a look at my older pictures taken from my Fuji, they are WAY too bright and in retrospect look quite horrible.  This Olympus' pictures are much softer and easy to look at, more true to life.  In the three months that I've had this camera I've come to realize that this camera really does take fabulous pictures, both in manual and auto mode.  I just can't say enough about the picture quality.One other factor for me was being able to print 4x6 photos on my HP printer.  I've been doing this now for a while and in many cases you're hard pressed to tell the difference.  I've also printed a couple of black and white 8x10's and they look great.  Each full resolution picture takes approximately 2-3 megabytes so make sure you have the disk space for these photos.Overall this camera is excellent.  I was hesitant to spend this much but I've really wanted a 5 MP and believe me it's worth it.  You can zoom and zoom in on a picture and the resolution doesn't change, thus making it easier to zoom in and crop for printing purposes.Buy it..you will NOT be disappointed.	1
Don't get this unless you intend to spend considerable time under your desk...  Mine works for up to two days at a time, whereupon I must climb under my desk to un and re-plug the USB ports in both computers to reactivate it.  Watch your head getting back up, and expect to do this several times a week.  Also, sound won't always shift with computers, so you'll get the sound from one computer with the KVM of the other.	0

Belkin F1DG102U Flip 2-Port KVM Switch with Audio Support (USB Connection)This switch worked the day I installed it.  At boot-up the next day it did not work on either computer.  After many fruitless attempts, I finally got it to go by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable to my computer; however, the unit failed to work again at boot-up. It appears that the only way for me to get it going is to unplug and re-plug the cable to the USB port on my computer each and every time I boot up.  I tried using three different USB ports on the computer but got the same result each time.I have the PS2 version of the same Belkin switch which works just fine all the time.  I bought the USB version to use with a wireless USB keyboard/mouse.  I switched back to the PS2 version and all works well now; however, I'm out 50-some dollars that I paid for the switch as well as the 120-some dollars that I paid for the USB wireless keyboard/mouse.	0
A very powerful, versatile, and impressive little camera.  For taking shots in conditions of plentiful light, this camera was hard to beat, at least when it came out (it's since been discontinued).  When it hit the market, it was unquestionably the most powerful digital camera of its size.There are problems, however:1.  On the little movies, there is no "sound" available.2.  You have to turn the camera off and close the cover to review the picture you just took!3.  This camera cannot take pictures in low lighting conditions at all.  Not without the flash, at any rate.  Starting from about the late afternoon on, this camera is all but useless for natural-looking shots.  They'll be far too blurry; this is a constant annoyance.Olympus recently came out with the C-60 Zoom, which is the new version of this camera.  With that one, they have fixed problems 1 and 2 but not 3:  still a major problem, but this is not the only brand of digital camera with this problem.Also note:  if you're replacing a c-50 with the new c-60, you'll be able to use your batteries, your battery charger, and your memory disks with the new version.  But the cable that connects the camera to your USB port is slightly different, so you won't be able to use that.Also, the C-60 can take memory cards of up to 512 MB!  This is pretty impressive (on the highest-quality setting, for example, this will allow you to take about 120 picutres; on the lowest-quality setting, over 6200!), although that's a pretty expensive little card.  With the C-50, coming out of the box the most it would take was a 256 MB card, unless you bodily sent the camera in to Olympus for a "firmware upgrade," which was free if you provided proof that you had bought a 512 MB card.  This is not necessary with the C-60.	1
Like most people I originally purchased this KVM in hopes that it would allow me to access both of my PCs using the same USB Kybd & Mouse.  The real selling point for this particular model was it also switched the audio along with the keyboard and mouse.  I really liked that option since it eliminated the need for additional speakers for my 2nd machine.  Like others who have reviewed this device - the scenario goes - it worked fine for the first few days - then it started screwing up.  It's been nothing but a headache ever since.  The mouse doesn't always track correctly - it's jittery and neither the mouse nor the keyboard successfully switch between machines on the first try.  I could live with the annoying 6 second switching time if the thing actually worked but since it doesn't - it's just another annoyance I have to deal with. I've had to disconnect and reconnect my machines from the switch numerous times just to get the darn thing to work. I'm absolutely shocked that Belkin would actually put out something of this low quality and reliability.  I've always had success with their products in the past which prompted me to purchase this device when I saw it on the store shelf. I guess I'm going to have to rethink Belkin. Save yourself 30 bucks and spend it on something else.  As soon as I find another device that does what I need it to do - this piece of crap is going in the trash.	0

Used this product to attempt to share a Samsung monitor, Dell keyboard, and Logitech mouse between two machines:  one XP and one Win 7.We could never get it to work reliably.  We ended up giving up and ordering a TrendNet, which worked right out of the box.We liked the concept of the Belkin button-click switch between computers, we just wish it would have worked!	0
Olympus has proven to be a worthy competitor in the camera industry. Today we take a look at one of their newer 5.0 megapixel cameras, the C-50 model. The camera packs many features that make it a perfect choice for aspiring professional photographers. The picture quality is quite good. The camera packs a handy 12x zoom (3x optical and 4x digital) and will take pictures at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels! In this review we will take a look at how easy it is to control the cameras advanced and not so advanced features, the quality of images produced, the movie capture mode, some very advanced technical specifications and, naturally, talk about how this camera stands out from the rest.

Bought this to use with my Mac Mini PPC and my new Mac Mini Intel.  Seemed to work at first, but then refused to recognize either the keyboard or mouse. (Macally and Kensington).  Took it back and exchanged it for the IOGEAR GCS632U, which works perfectly.  Instead of an unreliable external switch button, it uses a hot key.Beware of Belkin!LMCambridge MA	0

My experience was similar to what several others here have mentioned. The first day I hooked it up, it worked. The next day it did not. When I hit the button to switch computers I get unreliable results...usually it switches the video but not the mouse and keyboard. I have found that by flipping it about 4 times it will sync itself and I get control of the desired computer.You might have to jiggle the remote switch plug a little before you get contact. The light on the remote switch must glow either green or yellow. If not, jam the plug in harder.When it was working, I did find an annoying 6 second delay before the mouse and keyboard would activate. The video is instant. I'm also trying an Airlink 101 and I find it switches instantly, so it can be done.It's a nice attractive design and the snake style combined usb/video cable to the computer is great along with pervasive yet subtle color coding. I love the cute little remote switch button with long thin extension cable for convenient placement; it can also be used as a foot switch, which is great. I like having a dedicated hardware switch rather than hot-key only operation. Device requires no software....a major plus, but hotkey operation is available with a software download. Airlink 101 has a built in hotkey, Belkin should do that too since it allows hotkey operation with no software.Other people here have more patience or are more forgiving of quirks....they say it's finicky. Or in my case I could say "just click it four times and it might do it." Blather....it either works or it doesn't, and it don't! A simple device like this has no excuse not to work perfectly, all day, every day. How hard can it be...we're not splicing DNA here. A first rate design at a good price, unfortunately DOA.	0
I am a die hard Olympus fan.  This camera replaces a C-4040, which took great shots.  This small camera takes out of this world shots even at it's lowest setting.The small size does take getting used to after the C-4040.  But as the saying goes "Great things come in small packages".  That definately applies to the C-50.The manual does leave alot to be desired, but the menus for all the Olympus digitals are basically the same.  Just play around with it and you'll easily learn all the camera can do.It's also excellent that Olympus included the Lithium battery & charger.  It's alot better than using alkaline or other rechargeable batteries.	1
When I first plugged this thing in, it was great. I was amazed. I have used switches like this since the late 80's, and there were always problems. So I was surprised about how well this worked...then...two months later it started to lock up - unable to switch. Complete shut down of both computers for 5 minutes is the only way to clear it. I contacted Belkin - no solution or recourse. This product was new to the market when I got it. It needs more R&D time.	0

Well, darn.  When I connected my monitor to the KVM and then to my PC.. nothing.  Not switching cables, not pressing the flip switch.  Sorry to say, couldn't get it to work at all.	0
I had an Olympus 3040, which my wife took over, but I saw that she didn't always bring it places, because it's odd shape meant getting an medium sized camera bag. We got our nephew an Olympus C-40 when he and his wife had a baby, and they loved it. So, for her birthday this year, I went to get my wife one, only to find out the C-40 Zoom was no longer made, but the C-50 was even better (the new lithium-ion battery has longer life, and the XD Picture Cards are smaller and faster). She brings this camera everywhere, and besides the travel / family picts, she's now starting to take some artistic pictures, as the camera is always with her. If you can afford it, it's a great camera. Only drawback we've seen so far is the 3x optical zoom, and no ability to add an extender - but, I basically knew that going in, so I shouldn't complain!	1
I have a laptop running Vista and a desktop running XP, and I use a Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard. This unit was extremely frustrating because one minute it would work perfectly, and the next I would zero response from the unit when pressing the button. Even more frustrating was the fact that it would switch without warning, and any time it switched there would be a significant delay before I could use my mouse or keyboard again (4-5 seconds). I replaced it with an iogear unit which works much better, but still seems to have issues with remembering the custom key settings. More on THAT in another review. :)  I'd stay away from this belkin unless you really, really want to have a little wireless puck on your desk that doesn't work half the time.	0

This KVM switch seems to work at first. But it intermittently locks up, preventing the device from being switched. It also fails to render video at 1920x1200, despite claiming to do so in its specifications. When I run at this resolution the screen flickers and goes black.My company gave me one, so when it had the above problems I tried another unit, which had the exact same problems. I had these problems on Mac, Windows and Linux. The only solution was to use a different KVM switch.This is not a cheap switch either, so it gets 1 star.	0
pros:- 5MP resolution in a small, well-designed metal body.- allows a great deal of manual control.- good color reproduction.- higher than expected contrast from tonal balance.- low image noise with moderate shutter speeds.- spot metering.- shooting priority play mode (double press of quick view button).- good night exposures with automatic noise reduction.- solid build quality.- bright, high resolution LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating.- included Infrared remote control.- decent battery life (but i'd still recommend getting a spare).- compact dimensions 3.9 x 2.3 x 1.7 in, weighing 8.0 oz.cons:- some purple fringing / chromatic aberrations.- noisy images, &quot;jaggies&quot; visible.- limited adjustment on image parameters.- no manual white balance.- no manual focus.- some blue cast using the flash.- no AF illuminator.- high redeye occurrence.- poor movie mode when compared to competition.- manual is on CD.- LCD not very useful in very low light.- glacial write times for TIFFs.- slow image write times.- RAW format not supported.- you can't slide the lens cover to turn the camera on and off when mounted on a tripod nor can you change the battery or xD card.- poor macro ability.- fastest continuous shooting speed is only 1 fps.- no histogram display in record or play mode.- the supplied 32MB xD card is inadequate. be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for more memory.- the batteries supplied are proprietary so add a few bucks to your budget for a spare.the c-50z is a decent camera with 5MP resolution in a compact package.  but there is no manual white balance and no manual focus plus the images compare unfavorably against its competition.  at this price point, check out the canon s50.i hope this helps you in your buying decision. peace.	1
The directions are basically worthless; simple diagrams would do it but they make it much more complicated than it should be.  Beware that it will only work with USB keyboard and mouse -- I didn't catch that when I bought it.  Then, it doesn't work with a DVI monitor interface. I had to go buy a DVI to VGA converter.  I went to set it up and realized the mouse and keyboard on one computer are not USB.  I got tired of messing with it and threw it in a drawer, so it was a total waste for me.	0

Very frustrating to install and try to get operational.  I had good luck sometimes, then complete failure other times.  I am returning.  After installation it worked well, then I powered down the laptop.  I could not get it to switch back to the desktop without powering the laptop up again.  Just not ready for prime time.	0
4.5 StarsThis was the 5th digital camera I've bought and the second with a 5 MB image size.  I've been shopping for a small camera for well over a year and the features of the C-50 finally pushed me over the brink.  A year ago, we chose the Sony DSC-F707 for it's excellent optics and large image size.  Consumer digital has always had inferior image quality compared to even mediocre 35mm film cameras, but the 707 has been an excellent compromise.  The 707 is far too bulky to be a camera one could take anywhere, anytime, thus the search for something more compact.  The C-50 fits these requirements well.We also needed the small camera to be tough.  My wife plans to carry it in her purse nearly all the time and I want to use it on long rock climbs and for mountaineering.  The metal body of the C-50 protects the lens well when not in use and the whole camera has a rugged feel.  Considering how tough Olympus cameras have proven over the years, I expect this one to hold up well.It's trivial to learn to use the C-50, with most of the knobs and buttons having symbols that make sense and allow for intuitive learning.  The user's manual is adequate for learning the fine points.  The flexibility of opeartion is excellent and includes full manual exposure and spot metering, a real plus for capturing a high quality image when the ambient illumination is difficult.Just for fun, I compared the optical quality of the C-50 to our Sony F707, using both a professional copy stand and also using outdoor light while hand held.  In all cases, the Sony provided superior image quality, but the Olympus did very well in comparison, particularly at its widest angle setting.  Excellent wide angle performance has always been a hallmark for Olympus digital cameras, but remember that the Sony F707 costs 1.5 times what the C-50 does, so if you want a small camera with excellent image quality, the C-50 may be the best option currently available.	1
This is such junk. Dont spend your money on this, you will only have to return it. I purchased this same one from frys and its the same piece of junk. The iogear was junk too I had to retund it also. It seems nothing is made with pride these days just all junk from china.	0

I bought this and nearly ever time I switch computers, either my mouse or my keyboard stops working. The problem is apparently support for "multifunction USB devices" was left out of the product. To clarify: "multifunction USB devices" are things like a mouse with a scroll wheel or a keyboard with volume up/down buttons...the kind of thing that was shipped with every computer in the last 3-4 years.Even the rare time it did work, the switching process took a strangely long time. I am used to KVMs being "snappy" and being able to snap back and forth between computers. I would be tempted to race this thing against someone standing behind the desk swapping cables manually.The product was so poor I actually returned to swapping cables manually because it was easier than trying to fix the problem when the KVM failed to switch correctly (which was most of the time).All in all, it left me with a very dismal impression. It seems like, in an attempt to meet a consumer price point they missed the focus on the needs of the customer.	0
I think this camera is definitely worth the money. It takes great pictures and has many many features. Its easy to use once you use it a few times, or read the manual. Battery lasts a while, takes great close ups too! Non blurry. Sometimes get the red eye but depends what setting you have it on. Once you learn how to use it you know what setting is best for what it works wonders!	1
We bought the belkin dvi kvm switch for our son's computers (personal & cyber/charter school) -- we bought it direct from belkin, out of the box it was temperamental, and I only got it to work once. calling tech support (india) they finally determined 'it was the cables' and said we had to call another number to arrange an RMA. i had to give a credit card # if i wanted one shipped right away, and had to fight with them over not paying shipping (i already had paid for that once!) -- a week later i got another one .. only for it to work WORSE. the flip button is flimsy, doesn't work, and the entire design SUCKS. it seems to more work software based than hardware based.today i got my iogear 'Miniview micro DVI-D KVM with Audio and USB Hub' -- it worked IMMEDIATELY w/o any effort whatsoever. the bonus is that the iogear switch switches based on keyboard input as well as the little button (which is SOLID, NOT flimsy) ... the belkin only works via the keyboard after you've installed special software! (which isn't available for all OS's)we're also using the belkin (bought it also) ps/2 to USB cable that does actually work.DON'T BUY THIS SWITCH .. IT STINKS!! Get the Iogear!	0

It worked OK for a while, with a little delay.  Then I replaced one of the computers, and now it will work with one or the other computer as long as the other one is turned off.  Not exactly a convenient situation.  I'm going with something else.	0
I've been a big fan of Olympus from day one.  I've been using digital cameras for a few years but have never owned one until now, so I wanted to make sure I got the most bang for my buck.  I was looking at this camera and the Canon S45 which has just hit the shelves.  I opted for this camera over the Canon, despite it's few shortcomings.  Let me explain...To start off with, I'll give you the downside.  You can't record audio in movie mode (so, just get a video camera if you want to record videos).  Low lighting shooting can be difficult since there is no infrared sensor top assist with the shots.  Disappointing.  Finally, there is no manual focus, which could actually assist with the low light shooting, but alas, it was not included.  This is why I give it 4 stars.On the positive side, pictures are fantastic!  I take this camera with me everywhere and barely have to make any adjustments for my picture taking.  Also, the camera allows you to rotate the pictures and crop WITHIN the camera itself!!!  So, for those of you that take lots of portrait shots, like me, have that capability before downloading to your computer.  Such a time saver.The xD-picture card that it utilizes is the size of a postage stamp.  The card has a current capacity of 128 mb with the 256 mb card due by the end of this month.  In another year or so, the capacity will theoretically reach almost 8 gb!  That's an insane amount of pictures, but it's what you need on those vacations.Plus, the battery life is excellent.  I've used this thing like a workhorse and have taken pictures to fill up my 128 mb card, downloaded the pictures, and started taking more and still didn't have to recharge the battery.  I'm getting a backup just so I don't ever have to take my charger with me.Bottom line is this 5-megapixel camera has all of the bells and whistles you come to expect from Olympus and then some.  For a camera this small that I can pop in my pocket and forget about it, I think the money spent is well worth it, even with the 3 shortcomings I mentioned above.  I highly recommend it!	1
This is a very temperamental KVM.  One day it works fine but the next day it would stop working.  It seems that if all the computers are on all the time this switch may function ok but if one or both computers get powered down, the switch will stop working and it is very difficult to make it work again.	0

This has to be a case of a good idea, that just doesn't pan out.First off, the cord is short.  2ft + 2ft extension really isn't.  The ear buds are designed to route behind your neck, thereby eleminating a full foot of cord length.  Be prepared for a 3ft true length at best.Second, when you do route the cord behind your head, anytime you turn your head, it pulls on the earbud on the short side...everytime.  Very annoying.Third, if you route the cord normally in front of you, one side is x3 longer than the other (because it was designed to go behind your neck).  It doesn't work well, one side it taut the other has a ton of slack.It makes be wonder if they ever actually wore the earbuds before they put them up for sale.Lastly, the sounds was decent, good enough.Priced too high, annoying fit, not a whole lot of "premium" about these premium headphones.  Stay away.	0
This camera takes great shots - but low light is still an issue.  Even taking a picture of someone sitting inside with the sun shining on them through a window will still blur if there's any motion.It also takes a good 3 seconds or so for the camera to ready itself to take a picture.  I've missed a few spontaneous shots because it couldn't extend the lens fast enough.Other than that the camera is great.  It's super small, so it fits in my jeans pockets.  The 5 megapixels shots are huge and can make 8x10 prints.I would recommend a spare battery if you're going to do extensive shooting.  I usually recharge before I head off somewhere, but if you run out of juice halfway through your tourist day, you're out of luck until you can get back to the hotel and plug it in.	1
bought this before 6+ months, and today it just stopped working or to be fair, the right head stopped suddenly while in the middle of my sport session that even made me mad as hell. do not buy this garbage, look for anything else at least with quality.	0

I tried these as a replacement for ipod buds -- which are uncomfortable for me -- and these are no comparison.  Sound was muffled with no clarity.  Still looking for something decent...	0
As reported by others, my lens cover is giving up its ghost. The camera does not turn on everytime on first attempt. Opening the cover and general cleaning did not help. The power-down mechanism is still very effective though - sometimes in the middle of composing a shot, it would power down at the slightest provocation.It was a great camera 3+ years back with a solid feel and a compact size then. Now it is neither here nor there; the superzoom cameras have made a 3x optical lens obsolete (or, "entry" level only) and the really compact cameras have made this look like a tank.Losing a camera in slightly over 3 years is not good; my Minolta SLR from 1990 is still functional a 100%.I suppose it is time to buy again and I will buy another Olympus this time , probably the E-500 with dual lens kit. That would allow me to use the current remote - and I have been VERY satisfied with the optics.	1
I got these to supplement a set of Bang & Olfsen phones (good sound, poorplug design.) These sound almost as good but the uneven cord lengths, a heavy cord weight, when the extension is used, made this hard for me to use. It means that the ear buds were always popping out when i walked.I gave them to my son after a few weeks. These are better for using with a computer than an ipod.	0

the earphones have pretty good sound (compared to the ones that come with ipods) they can handle the bass that the ipod earphones can'tbut they do not stay in my ear at all! i have to KEEP ON adjusting them in order to prevent them from falling out. if i didn't do this, they would fall out so easily! the cord is too short and yes, i do know they go around the back of the neck but there really is no slack on the cord. even though there is an extension cord, the cord is too long! there is no medium! also the plug in for the extension cord weighs down the earphones, so i can't walk too fast or else the plug will start swinging around and eventually make my earphones fall out.	0
I have owned four Olympus digital cameras and this is the best of the lot.  I took my Olympus C-50 to Switzerland last spring and it performed beautifully.  The battery held a charge far longer than I expected.  The settings on the camera are a bit complex, but I managed to deal with most of them after a short time. The picture quality is fantastic for any camera available today and for a camera so small and light weight it is just what a traveling photographer needs.  This camera is all metal and as rugged as can be.  I am no expert, but the Olympus C-50 is the best camera I have ever taken on one of my trips.When I got home the downloading to my PC was a breeze.  I use Camedia Master to put my digital photos onto a CD-R disk. I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants high performance in a very small (shirt pocket) package.	1
Ordered this battery for my past family runion and was not able to use it b/c the battery cause my camera to get hot and not function. I didn't find out it wasn't a properly working battery until after the 30 day return policy. WILL NOT use this vendor again. THANKS!	0

Although this looks like a CRV3 battery in the picture and turns up on an Amazon search for rechargeable CRV3 battery it is NOT a CRV3.  While it fits in a CRV3 camera and charger (barely) the terminals are not the same and it will not work.  I can't imagine why Kodak would create a proprietary battery type that is so similar to a standard battery to ensure confusion.  My mistake though - it doesn't actually say it is a CRV3 in the description.  But you just sort of figure that camera companies have a bit of common sense and make their proprietary battery packs distinctive from common battery types.	0
Pros: Ultra compact, five megapixels, manual exposure options, Compact, high resolution, razor sharp, bright LCD, Small, lithium ion battery/charger, picture quality, compactness, easy to use, loaded with advanced features yet point-and-shoot simple on automatic, multiple resolution options, including uncompressed TIFF, compact and light.Cons: No LCD screen cover, no AF assist light, questionable low-light capabilities, many settings, price, uses new xD picture card, Poor LCD viewing in very low light, extremely slow save for TIFFs, occasional image noise, works poorly with a tripod.Summary: I did quite a bit of research before deciding on the Olympus C50. I wanted a small digital camera that had some manual controls. The camera also had to feel sturdy and have a menu system that was intuitive for me. The C50 won out over my other choices hands down (Minolta F100 and Nikon CP4500). Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and can live with the little quirks I've read about with this camera. The remote comes in handy when displaying your pictures on TV. Also, the battery life on this little guy is quite good -- much better than the Kodak I had. Olympus could have done a better job on the printed manual. The manual on CD is much better and they should have just printed out that manual in the appropriate language for the countries they ship to.	1
It seems to be well built, but I do find myself having to bang on some of the keys rather more than usual to register. Especially for upper case. And I'm a heavy hitter of the keys too! But otherwise fine, and for the price is great. I'd resent paying more than $30 on other keyboards that only cost a few bucks to make.	0

I bought this cable thinking it was a 4-core AV-cable which terminated onto 3-pole 3.5mm RCA jacks on either end, the kind that are used as AV cables for some camcorders and dual-screen DVD players. Unfortunately that was not the case. The jacks on either end of the cable are just regular 2-pole RCA jacks or 2-channel (RL) RCA headphone jacks, no Video.Anyway, returned them to get a refund. If you are looking for an AV cable, this is not it.. unlike what the picture shows. 2-stars as I'm sure it function perfectly well as a 2-pole audio cable.	0
I have been a serious amateur for 30 years, starting with Nikons and moving through a number of other mechanical SLRs.  I was impressed with this camera.  To a few who critize battery life I offer the following advice: read the instructions when all else fails!  The battery must be removed when not in use.  An unfortunate need as it affects convenience, but documented in the instructions nevertheless.  A small demand apparently will drain the battery over time even when turned off.  Olympus should fix this with a switch or timer of some sort to break the connection...easy to do.  The pictures I have taken so far are equal to my Nikon and pentax 35mm stuff.  I took a test shot out of the box of a bouquet on our table before even charging the unit and my wife made it the wallpaper for our computer.  Shots like that.  The resolution was incredible too.  Took a close shot of a friend and was able to zoom in on the computer until he and I discovered he had a rye seed stuck in between his teeth which was not otherwise noticable to either of us...amazing resolution IMO.	1
The Griffin TuneJuice 2 Battery Backup for iPod is deemed by most reviewers as pretty lame as a battery extender and charger. But there is an alternative, and it is quite good in terms of performance and value.It is called Music Power 0900-72 Encore Dual Port USB AC Charger with Rechargeable Extended Battery.It is not a one-piece design like the Kensington Mini Battery Extender and Charger, but because of that, it is more flexible (It's a general purpose portable/AC 2-port USB charger) and will allow me to continue my Skype session without interruption. In other words, I can CHARGE my iPod Touch and USE my headphone/microphone at the same time. Not only that, there is no issue with having to remove iPod Touch's protective case if you have one, or having to maintain a certain angled contact between the battery and the iPod for positive charging to take place. For me, this is a much better and more practical solution to extending the use of my iPod Touch. And it is also cheaper than the Kensington, plus you will most likely be able to use this battery on future versions of iPod and things that rely on USB power. I highly recommend it (Music Power 0900-72 Encore).	0

I can confirm that this product is definitely not compataible with the Ipod Touch 2g (wrong charging voltage causes error message), and I've also heard it won't work with the Iphone 3G.	0
I had originally written a review for the Tivoli site but apparently they won't post criticism.I have 3 of these, for one reason: They are a good match for my 50-year-old KLH Model Eight/Model Thirteen compact stereo systems. The Model Eight was Henry Kloss's first electronic product and the Tivoli Model One FM radio was his last. The CD matches the styling of the One (which was modeled on the Eight).When my first Model CD (purchased new) died I took it to an excellent technician, one I've used many times, and his advice was to junk it. He had opened it up, discovered it was very cheaply built, but had also contacted Tivoli for repair parts. They said it could only be repaired by them. So I sent it to Tivoli. Turns out they would replace it with a refurbished model for a flat $50. Not bad. They were even flexible enough to let me choose what color I wanted (the traditional walnut/beige was not available when I bought the unit new). Nice!I bought a second one, used, and of course it died too so I sent it to Tivoli with $50 and got a refurb. Again, the guys at Tivoli were very nice and they allowed me to choose the walnut/beige color. So far, an unreliable product but great customer service.So I bought a third one second-hand knowing it was broken. Figured I'd send that one in for a refurb as well. No such luck. They have changed the policy so now if the player is 2 years old (or if you don't have a receipt) they take it back and give you a coupon for 50% off anything purchased on their site (good for 2 years). So a refurbished model, instead of costing $50 will cost $125.50. Or a new one would be $150.As far as I'm concerned there is ONLY ONE REASON to buy this over-priced and unreliable CD player and that is to have a setup that visually matches other Henry Kloss products. The walnut/beige unit looks very nice with a Model Eight and Thirteen, or sitting next to a KLH Model Eighteen tuner.So unless you are a Henry Kloss enthusiast/collector as I am, you would be better off with a less expensive CD player or a higher quality one. For $300 (or $400 for the lacquered cabinet) this is a very bad buy.EDIT: Please see response from Tivoli. My 1st Model CD was an early one and apparently Tivoli realized the transport mechanism was junk and they have since re-designed these to use a better quality Phillips transport. If the quality and reliability have improved that's great news. The CD is a very nice looking and compact unit, and the company is very good. Only time will tell but IF the quality has been significantly improved I would now give it 4 stars.	1
Be aware when buying this product that it doesn't have any overcharge protection on it, so it doesn't work with new ipod touch 3g+ or any model of iphone.  The first week I had it the clip that keeps the case over the batteries snapped off; it's pretty touchy.	0
I had originally written a review for the Tivoli site but apparently they won't post criticism.I have 3 of these, for one reason: They are a good match for my 50-year-old KLH Model Eight/Model Thirteen compact stereo systems. The Model Eight was Henry Kloss's first electronic product and the Tivoli Model One FM radio was his last. The CD matches the styling of the One (which was modeled on the Eight).When my first Model CD (purchased new) died I took it to an excellent technician, one I've used many times, and his advice was to junk it. He had opened it up, discovered it was very cheaply built, but had also contacted Tivoli for repair parts. They said it could only be repaired by them. So I sent it to Tivoli. Turns out they would replace it with a refurbished model for a flat $50. Not bad. They were even flexible enough to let me choose what color I wanted (the traditional walnut/beige was not available when I bought the unit new). Nice!I bought a second one, used, and of course it died too so I sent it to Tivoli with $50 and got a refurb. Again, the guys at Tivoli were very nice and they allowed me to choose the walnut/beige color. So far, an unreliable product but great customer service.So I bought a third one second-hand knowing it was broken. Figured I'd send that one in for a refurb as well. No such luck. They have changed the policy so now if the player is 2 years old (or if you don't have a receipt) they take it back and give you a coupon for 50% off anything purchased on their site (good for 2 years). So a refurbished model, instead of costing $50 will cost $125.50. Or a new one would be $150.As far as I'm concerned there is ONLY ONE REASON to buy this over-priced and unreliable CD player and that is to have a setup that visually matches other Henry Kloss products.

This is NOT a backup battery for your IPod. The TuneJuice2 will only work if your IPod already has a charge. To quote from the packaging "..an IPod with a completely discharged internal battery will not be able to make use of TuneJuice's battery backup capability". So if you have visions of attaching TuneJuice2 to your dead IPod and getting unlimited playtime by just popping in new AAA batteries, do not buy this product!The text on the Amazon web page for TuneJuice2 says "Ever run out of iPod battery without a power source in sight?". I think if you buy this product you will realize how misleading it is.	0
I am using it with a plug in mini plug to the pod on a Bose Computer Sound System. It works beautifully.(Thanks Amazon for the upgraded shipping.) This unit's heft shows heritage of design along the lines of expensive car deluxe CD players. Size is perfect and sits inconspicuously on my small bookcase. The fluorescent display is great,no way it could be improved.  The player loads and plays the disk automatically.Slick. The remote is a coup d'etat of just the right size and easy to read symbols. Important, else you would be hard pressed to see and fumble for the function keys on the unit if you are not eagle eyed.(This is an industry design thing that aint never going to go way) Summary: I think Tivoli put their money and value in this one. And recommend it,even if you don't use it w the Tivoli radio. The 12 Volt option is one I may explore. That would mean getting a back seat amp to the rear of my VW wagen. But it remains possible,so that is a design plus for this company. Hats off to Tivoli, my garden spot for small discrete audio gear...with minimum of glitz and faddishness. GS	1
There are two models advertised on Amazon. This one is a few bucks more and is supposed to operated on 1.2 GHz BUT it does not!While the unit does cost a few bucks more it still operates on the old 2.4 GHz frequency that has a great deal of interference.  This camera is on the same 2.4 GHz freq as my X10 wireless video cameras and I can't use it.The receiver actually has a 2.4 GHz decal (NOT a 1.2 GHz)The frequency is important especially if you have other wireless devices (cameras, Internet Routers, etc that work on the 2.4 GHz band.Rip off! If you expect to get what's advertised, you won't...This was sold by Amazingtech Inc Via Amazon.comAngered...	0

I purchased this item to be used as a baby monitor because it's way cheaper than a regular  baby monitor unit you would buy at baby stores. Besides, I already have a  small tv monitor and I just needed this wireless camera and receiver. It works just fine and it transmit signal from the camera to the receiver about 30 to maybe 50 feet away, upstairs and downstairs the house...the only problem I encountered was it shut down my wireless router..and the resolution is expected for its price..reasonable and it would  have some minor static on the tv screen.. Otherwise, it works.	0
I received the Tivoli Model CD Player as a Christmas gift to add to my Tivoli Satellite (Sirius) radio.  I also own the extra Tivoli speaker which makes the system truly stereo.  The CD player attached easily and was working in a matter of minutes.  Overall, the controls are simple and easy to use.  I especially like using the remote control since it's convenient and easy to read.  The sound from this system is amazing.  The clarity, depth and richness of sound from this little system is worth every penny.  And, it's beautiful to look at.  I have the system in my office and often receive compliments on its appearance.  If you're looking for a compact, attractive, easy to assemble and use system, the Tivoli is perfect for you.	1
"New high power 1.2 GHz technology provides 300 feet range with solid stability"Deascription states that item is 1.2ghz Item is actually 2.4ghz I bought the 1.2 and 2.4 packages and both were the same item, from the same seller and Fullfilled By Amazon. Same Item, two different Asin's and the other Asin cost less.	0

It is small, pretty, comfortable and cheap but is sensitive to interference from wireless equipment and then it works fine, bad emits audio and video signal. It's a shame because as comfortable as can be put in any place without being seen.	0
The tag price of MZ-N10 Net MD is too high for what it has to offer. For above $300, one would expect MZ-N10 to have the a radio/TV/weather-band, a capability Sony MZ-NF610 offers for only $199. As well, the line-in for microphone, without an actual microphone included, comes too little, and comes too late. It comes too little for reasons that seem to annoy so many prosumers: not being able to upload the recorded content, despite being able to easily differentiate between mic-recordings and transfers from a computer.  It comes too late because SHARP had a model on the market that was equipped  with microphone line-in some 2 years ago, for only $170 at that time. The differentiation between content that's been recorded (via mic) and downloaded could be easily addressed by a software patch!As somebody here put it, 5 stars for the technology, 1 star for its flexibility, and 2  stars for the price/value ratio, that's 3 stars average.	1
The camera itself works really good, but the problem is that a new 9v battery will be totally dead in 90 minutes. So where ever you may need it, make sure that you have an alternate power source.	0

The range and signal quality are well below claims and expectation. Even at 10 feet the picture signal is very noisy and drops off through one wall and 30 feet to useless. The sound pickup of the Mic in a quiet room at 10 feet was very muffled sounding. Plus no documentation of any kind which means you have play with dip switches randomly and try to figure out what they do.	0
The unit itself is good, but the software that supposedly downloads music from your computer to the minidisc is lousy.  The result skips and inserts large blank sections throughout all the songs.  Not a very good result for the price Sony asks for this minidisc.	1
Third time in two months that Amazon has sent me something that is supposedly new in an opened, scotch-taped package!  This is outrageous and I am getting sick of it. I waited since mid-January for this. I waited patiently. Imagine my disappointment to find a used ear buds case in a broken up package. Gee ma!  Just what I wanted!  An earbuds case with someone else's ear wax in it!  YUCK Shame on Amazon. They did this with two sets of expensive outdoor speaker that I ordered recently too. They're getting as bad a Fry's.	0

The case is sturdy and looks good.  I think it will last a long time, had it a week now.  The logo on the top of the case rises about an 1/8 inch above the case so makes it catch when I try to slide it in my bag or pocket.  The most disappointing is the buds don't go in easily.  You still have to wind them up and shove them in the case.  Long time ago I bought cheap $4.95 ear buds to get through a flight.  They came in a hard plastic case, puck shaped like this one.  The difference was that case had a molded slot in the middle for each bud then you simply wound the cord around the puck and it closed in on itself.  I'm going to look for that case instead.	0
For some reason, MDs didn't get far, in spite of their recording quality for live music is, in my experience, unsurpassed.I agree with "fCh" (GMT-5, USA) that its intended audience may be: "For die-hard Sony/gadgetry fans".

Earbuds Travel Case for JLab JBuds, blue. The earbuds do fit, and it is an OK case to carry them in, but the construction of the case is shoddy at best. The zipper is glued on by hand, as it goes from low on one side to high on the other, one side is loose the other side is so tight, sooner or later the zipper will separate, making the case useless. I gave 2 stars because of its short life expectancy.	0

For those who spent big on this item when it was new, I can certainly understand why someone would have been angry about NetMD (or the limitations of NetMD).  I learned this before I purchased one of these units.I bought the unit primarily for field recording, quick-and-dirty analog sound recording, and for a portable, small-size solution for recording DJ mixes and live performances that I do.In this capacity, no Sony MD walkman has ever failed me in this respect.For those who believed they were getting a digital copier-MD was always limited in this way...however, I have found that there is very little difference in the sound quality between one of my all digital recordings, and the same recording played back from my minidisc.If you want to do a digital-to-digital copy like from a recorder to a computer...SPEND THE MONEY AND BUY A SONY PORTABLE DAT...they did make those too.for my use though, this thing is sleek, portable, durable, and most of all, functional.  Learn it and it's your good friend...I would not pay $370 for it again...but...And Sony does still have SOME  of the parts for these...I was able to order the power supply and charging cradle (free shipping:)...it took a while, but well worth it to have my favorite MD back.This was what we all called the 'POOR MAN'S DAT.'

This case was cheaply made, and looks horrible.The picture is very misleading - in normal light, the colors look atrocious. Also, the paint on the sides of it was hand done by someone, and looks very tacky/poorly made. The whole thing feels very cheap and tacky, I would never take it anywhere. DLO was also very unhelpful, they refused to refund, exchange, or do anything about their crappy product. Worst $20 I ever spent.	0

I like the BoxWave Styra a lot but after only a couple of weeks use and even less use of the pen the Styra fell apart. Whenever I attempt to use the pen the insert that connects the cap with the barrel of the Styra pulls out of the Styra's barrel.I'll probably glue the insert in with some super glue but I shouldn't have to muck with a product as expensive as the Styra.I wouldn't buy another one.	0
...even though I also have a D60.  The N75 (AKA F75) has amazing features, especially considering the price and weight.It's like having an FX camera without having to pay for an FX camera.Pros:-It works with all Nikon autofocus lenses.  This includes AF, AFS, D, G.  VR works.  DX lenses work, but at their widest zooms you lose the corners.  This means I only need one set of lenses for the N75 and the D60.-The N75 with the Nikkor 50mm 1.8 AF lens is an excellent, classic combination for very little money.  Many of the best photographers have done most of their work with a 35mm SLR and a 50mm lens.-The metering is excellent.  Not need to worry about exposure.  Override settings only needed in unusual situations.-Same shooting "modes" as on a new DSLR.  A Nikon digital user who runs out of battery can switch to this and hardly notice a difference.-In many shooting situations, film still gives better results than digital.  Try it with Fuji Superia or shoot architecture or nature with Fuji Velvia and a tripod.  You can't get that kind of color with digital, at any price.-It weighs nothing.  Put that 50mm lens on it and it weighs half what an FX camera without lens weighs.-Film is cool.Cons:-Pre-AF lenses (AI/AIS) work but only in manual mode without metering.-Vignette when misusing DX lenses on film cameras.-You'll need the film.-When I shoot film I get it processed and scanned to CD with no prints.  Some photo labs won't give me high resolution on these scans.-Won't let me use the lens's aperture ring.  Aperture ring must be locked except in full-manual mode without metering.  (This is true with most Nikons.)One more thing.  A lot of people seem to think that which film SLR you have makes a big difference in your image quality.  This isn't true.  All an SLR does is hold the film and operate the lens - the shutter gets out of the way and the lens focuses light on the film.  The shutter and meter in this cheap camera are as good as the shutter and meter in many much more expensive cameras, and those are the only parts of the camera body that affect imag quality.	1
The nib is very bad and cracks easily. After that you can pretty much throw the pen away.Try the bamboo instead, as you can replace nibs easily. The nibs get soft after  a while of writing and need replacement.Dont buy this and waste your money on this.	0

Camera Armor by Made Products is an idea that does not work very wellAfter extensively using this product on a Central & South America adventure I encountered many problems. Some are as follows:1. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE- MADE PRODUCTS refused to even acknowledge there are problems with the design of Camera Armor. or give a refund as requested2. The auxillary battery pack is difficult to attach or even make connection/contact with the camera.3. Body Armor attracks unwanted dirt,lint,etc to the camera that can get on the sensor when changing the lens4. Body Armor will trap moisture against the camera that can get into the workings of the camera. This happened in the Tropics of Costa Rica.5. Camera Armor often prevents the pop up flash from fully engaging EVEN WHEN PROPERLY fit on the camera body.6. Camera Armor impeeds easy access to some camera functions.7. Camera Armor is difficult to fit onto some tripods8. The Protective lens covering does not really protect anything. It is a glorified lens hood.I reviewed in great detail these issues and more with representatives of a national Pro camera store and they agreed. In fact I was offered a refund even though Camera Armor was not purchased through them.	0
I bought the N75 as a move back to SLRs from my Olympus digital point-n-shoot.  I have some older Olympus SLRs but wanted auto focus and program to make it easier for my wife.  I looked at both the N75 and Rebel Ti as springboards for buying some good lenses and moving up to digital SLRs when the price came down.I'm very happy with mine and haven't had (or heard of) any problems with this camera other than the other reviewers.  I've taken pictures in a variety of settings - Summer, snow (incl. snowing), indoors ,etc and they've all turned out great.  I upgraded to the XR series of lenses and am Extremely happy with them.  Now I'm just waiting to see what happens with D100 (and it's promised &quot;little brother&quot;) and am seriously checking out the Fuji S2 Pro.	1
I expected "night vision" to gather more light, amplifying and contrasting it beyond what the unaided human visual system does.  The iGen box says it amplifies light 650x.However, the unit saw less than dark-adapted eyes. 10 minutes in a dark room and dark-adapted eyes saw book shelves 15 feet away outlined, with individual books having hints of letters on their spines. Meanwhile, this unit saw nothing: a blank screen on highest gain and slowest frame rate (2 fps).Pan to objects lit by light streaming through the window curtains  (as seen by dark-adapted eyes) and this unit only starts to see something. It seemed perhaps 1/10th the sensitivity of human eyes, perhaps less.Worse, the brightly backlit LCD screen destroys the dark adaptation in one eye, even on lowest setting and "red" display. The display is so bright, it can be used as a projector out the back-end onto a post-card image on the wall a foot away. So imagine walking down a trail at night with only one eye adapted to the night, the other eye, the "night-vision" eye, blacked out.This unit didn't make much sense to me.When the IR illuminator is turned on, the situation changes. One can read the books across the room as if the room light was on.The box says it casts an "invisible" IR beam, but it does not. The beam projection can be seen by dark-adapted eyes at least 15 feet away, probably longer. The red LED generating the beam is itself visible at a very long distance, if looked at directly. A bit like Hal, the computer, in the movie "2001".So: if you don't mind being blind in one eye, and your wildlife is insensitive to a big glowing red orb swinging around, you might find an application for it.Build quality is good, but never really found a comfortable way to hold the bulbous shape. There is no provision for lanyard attachment or neck-strap. Comes with a nice, though not rugged case..If the IR illuminator wasn't visible to the naked eye, and the cost was ~ $150 or less, I might have kept it, but probably wouldn't have ever used it due to screen brightness blowing out one eye.	0

First, this item was purchased through Warehouse Deals.  The item arrived in good physical condition except for scratches around the main lens opening (in metal).The problem is the external I/R illuminator infrared LED is dislodged so that the picture in the viewfinder has dark triangular spots in the lower corners, when the illuminator is switched-on.  The dark areas are there and vary in size according to distance of viewed objects, and vary in darkness depending on how well lit the target is in the corner areas.  At long distances, only the lower right corner has the dark triangle.I'm guessing the unit was dropped, hence someone returned it, or it was a display model that suffered impact damage to the orientation of the external I/R emitter.I normally don't buy used/refurbished items, but thought I'd take a chance on this as the price was discounted.  If someone had actually checked this unit out properly, before putting the Amazon stamp of approval to sell, this review wouldn't be here.Haven't decided to return it yet, or live with the problem.  This is the third item in as many purchases I've had problems with through Amazon, so no more purchases for me from this company.EDIT: I have since found 9 stuck white pixels appearing on the display, when viewing dark areas at moderate gain.  That's it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  Color me disappointed, as there is no excuse for anything like this to get out of Warehouse Deals.EDIT: I purchased a new Amazon Night Owl, and it works beautifully.  Very impressed with its feature set and operation.	0
Hello?!!! Why would anyone bother to buy a film camera, in these days of raging digital slr fever? In fact, why bother with an auto-focus film SLR at all, when you can buy manual focus Nikon SLRs and go fully retro if you're really nostalgic for those "good-ole" noisy, fiddly, bulky SLR days?Let me tell you why. It makes sense. At least from a serious hobby photographer like myself. I have a digital slr and a couple of manual focus Nikon cameras. My dslr is my main camera. But I still love to shoot film. I still love to make a fuss just to create one picture, wait for it to be developed and printed. I like shopping for various film ISOs, load film, hear the whir of the film advance mechanism. I am one of those nuts who love to unroll a developed negative and still be fascinated with the organic, almost magical nature of it all!Now I choose the Nikon F75/N75 because I wanted the convenience of automation while still shooting film. F100s, even F80s are still very expensive for me, not to mention F5s and F6s. The other choices were N55, N60, N65 but going through their individual reviews, I know I wont be satisfied with them. I therefore got myself an N75 with databack and MB-18 battery grip. This is a fantastic combination! Reviews about it correctly state that this is a beginner's camera with option for more advanced photographers. When you know nothing of photography principles but savvy enough to know that an SLR is superior to a point and shoot, this is for you. Once you gain some skills in photography, this camera will open up options that will test your knowledge.Here are the things I like about the N75:1. CenterWeighted (CW) metering in Manual Mode. Some reviews mention this as a disadvantage, prefering CW metering as an option available in any mode. What is CW metering anyway? Does the intended target of this camera care? If you dont know what the heck it is, you'll thank Nikon for putting CW in Manual Mode only! Because you will only use Manual mode anyway when you want to be creative about your exposure- overriding the meter, using off-camera flash, etc-which means you know your photography. In all other modes the camera uses the reliable Matrix meter. With a little insight you can even override that using the easy-to-use exposure compensation!2. Spot meter available only in AutoExposure lock button and must be customized. Again, there are reviews that diss this method, preferring to have spotmeter freely available in all modes. Let me ask you. Do you know what is spot meter? Do you know how to use it? Do you know the zone system? If you don't and chances are you are one of the intended target of this camera, you will also thank Nikon for putting spot meter this way. You cannot accidentally switch it. You must intentionally and deliberately customize it to use it which means you must know how to use it. If it were freely available in all options and you dont know what it does, you may very well be in for the shock of your life to see severely overblown and under-exposed photos come from your negatives when you shot using spot meter under very common lighting situations. And then you will blame Nikon for making such a crappy camera!3. Film prewind. People have mixed reaction to this facility. It takes getting used to. Personally I like it. When you use the battery pack and grip MB-18 like I do, it only takes 10 seconds flat to prewind a 36 exposure film. That's plenty fast enough for me. What's more, if you accidentally opened the back midroll you would have saved your previous shots since they are already inside the film canister.4. The camera has a dedicated optional MB-18 battery grip which has its own vertical shutter release and power on switch! I guess there will be no argument here. The convenience of using AA batteries over exhorbitantly priced, one-use lithiums is obvious. You will be pleased with the ease with which to take pictures when holding the camera vertically.5. It has 12 custom functions. For that time when you know a bit more than a beginner and want a taste of a little adventure in your photography. Go to spot meter, CW meter, multiple exposures. Heck go and bracket your exposures! You already know these stuff, right? When you feel you need instant access to these advanced options then perhaps you can invest in more expensive cameras.6. It comes with a model which have data back. Here is another much maligned facility. Some folks say those tiny date imprints are unprofessional and distract from the subject. I dont know about you. But I am not shooting for museum galleries or for national geographic magazine or any news agency. I am shooting pictures for much more special clients: my family and friends. I am really pleased to be able to imprint dates in pictures since for me they add points of interest when we later look at them in our favorite chair or pillow.7. The sound of shutter release is subdued. Motor whir which advances film is also quiet. I just love it.Now some of the things I consider areas for improvement- bearing in mind this is just a beginner-to-serious amateur camera:1. A brighter viewfinder screen.2. Option to switch on grid lines (like that in the N80.)3. Ability to meter with manual focus lenses. then again, what beginner has them?A little faster continuous mode would be really nice like 2-3 frames per second instead of 1.5 fps and a slightly stronger builtin flash would be good.Although this is a plastic camera, it is very well built and beautiful to look at. I heartilly recommend the N75/F75 to all amateurs and beginners who are on a tight budget for an AF film SLR yet want the option of more advanced features when knowledge grows. I also recommend getting the MB-18 battery grip. It is not much of an added weight or price. But the convenience and economy it provides is big.There is unique joy in shooting film that digital has not yet replaced and probably never will. The F75/N75 delivers the goods!If you are already adept in photography, have a formidable collection of manual focus lenses and wanted a film AF SLR, go for the F100 and higher.As for me, I am very happy with my N75.	1
I love the concept behind having the ability to store custom profiles in the meter for your lenses.  What I have noticed is the settings do not seem to stay, after about two weeks of shooting I noticed that all of my pictures on all my profiled lenses were all overexposed.  I tried to recalibrate them and I continued to have overexposed pictures.One major negative that I, along with many other people, have noticed is that once you load a custom profile you cannot delete it from your meter using the DTS (version 3.0).  I cannot imagine why Sekonic did not add a feature to delete profiles from your meter using the DTS.  The only way I was able to delete my custom profiles was to remove the battery while I had the meter turned on.Another negative I have noted is the instructions are not very user friendly.  I'm not sure who writes the instruction manuals, but I had to google stuff to actually figure out how to use the settings.	0
Hello?!!! Why would anyone bother to buy a film camera, in these days of raging digital slr fever? In fact, why bother with an auto-focus film SLR at all, when you can buy manual focus Nikon SLRs and go fully retro if you're really nostalgic for those "good-ole" noisy, fiddly, bulky SLR days?Let me tell you why. It makes sense. At least from a serious hobby photographer like myself. I have a digital slr and a couple of manual focus Nikon cameras. My dslr is my main camera. But I still love to shoot film. I still love to make a fuss just to create one picture, wait for it to be developed and printed. I like shopping for various film ISOs, load film, hear the whir of the film advance mechanism. I am one of those nuts who love to unroll a developed negative and still be fascinated with the organic, almost magical nature of it all!Now I choose the Nikon F75/N75 because I wanted the convenience of automation while still shooting film.

The memory button rubber cover fell off when I took it out the box and it took a couple of minutes to come alive. Sold it to a friend and got a Kenko. Looked really nice too.	0
I love my Nikon N75 - it's by far the best camera I've ever owned.  I've had it for several months now, and have taken the best pictures of my life with it.  A great first SLR, due to the ability to leave it in fully automatic mode at first, and then start using the expanded features as you learn.I mainly wanted to write this review to debunk the 'error' a previous reviewer was complaining about.  They really should read the owner's manual...  The 'film not loaded error icon' that they are talking about is used in two ways on this camera.  If when you first load the film, something goes wrong, this will blink to indicate the film was not loaded correctly.  The second use is as a 'low-film' indicator.  When you're looking through the viewfinder, this light will blink when you hit 5 exposures left.  It's obviously meant to let you know you're getting close to the end of your film, so you don't miss that 'perfect shot' due to running our of film.  The fact that the reviewer went through several of these cameras, and never figured this out astounds me.  I've never had to contact Nikon support, but I would hope that the support person I got would be a little more knowledgeable than the people she talked too...Overall, if you're looking to get started with an SLR, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I would, however, suggest that you visit your local Ritz (or equivilent camera shop) to hold onto the camera, and compare it to a few others.  I was all set to buy a Canon Rebel Ti, based soley on reviews - until I went to the shop.  It just felt wrong in my hands, where the Nikon felt perfect.  It's all a matter of personal preferrence, so you'll want to make sure you're getting the right one.I've also been pretty hard on this camera since I got it (Ritz has an optional replacement warranty, so I've not been too worried) - including getting it soaked on a boat trip.  It's kept on going through everything I've thrown at it - very durable.Pros:-Can be used as a point-and-shoot when needed (or while learning)-Has the ability to control every aspect of the picture taking process.-Great built in flash-Amazing 25 point 3D metering system-Controls are all easily accesible while holding the camera-In my opinion, it just feels sturdier and more comfortable in your hand than the Canon Rebel Ti - Canon's equivilant cameraCons:-Being an SLR, it's a little on the big side.  It is, however, lighter than you might expect.  Basically, you have to be making the commitment to carrying it around with you.  For this, I'd highly recommend one of the lowepro bags - they're about the smallest you can get for this type of camera.	1
It would take a lifetime to master all the intricacies of this pricey gadget. First off, you have to calibrate it, then calibrate your camera or cameras to use this, etc. etc.  I guess this is great for professional photographers because of its myriad capabilities, although even pros don't want to spend too much time fiddling with a light meter; it can be too distracting. It's probably a 5-star product but it's not for me - I'm a serious photographer but not a pro.	0

I had high hopes for this product. I do some 3D modeling now and then, and figured a 3D navigational device would be a great help. The product itself is good. It has a great feel with three rotational directions - roll, pitch and yaw - and three motion directions - up-down, left-right and forward-backward. I am sure many will find this to be a wonderful gadget.My problem was with Poser 8. I downloaded and installed the drivers. That went smoothly enough. I was indeed able to move about in my scenes, looking this way and that, but there was no way to manipulate and item or parameter using the navigator. This seemed to be an obvious feature, but a check of the documentation - such as it is - showed nothing. Still, being able to move my main camera around in the scenes was pretty useful.Then, as I loaded in more complicated scenes, Poser 8 started to crash randomly and frequently. I installed the various Poser 8 updates and reinstalled the driver with no change in behavior. I undid the installation, the crashes stopped.I wound up returning the device. I still think it is a pretty neat device and will meet the needs of many other customers, but it doesn't work with my configuration. As always, your mileage may vary.	0
I bought this camera for a several reasons, as a backup to my aging Nikon 8008s (still going strong after 10 years!) and for a film body to use Nikon "G" lenses, and because of the Nikon USA Fall rebate.Upon first opening the box I thought I'd made a real mistake. It's the lightest 35mm SLR I've ever used. The viewfinder is rather small and none too bright. Compared to the 8008s the N75 feels like a disposable camera!Upon inserting the batteries and mounting a 50mm Nikon lens, things began looking up. I bought the body only, and strongly recommend you do the same, and get a Nikon AF 50mm 1.8 lens. This camera balances beautifully with this prime lens! My hands are small, so the N75 felt just right. Autofocus is quick, and I like the red confirmation light in the finder (same as on my D 70 digital SLR).When it comes to focus speed and silence, the N75 blows my old 8008s out of the water. It's focus rarely hunts and the shutter is fairly quiet, as is the drive motor. Switching to Manual Exposure mode is quick and easy. This camera even has a depth of field preview button.Overall this has become a favorite film camera because it is so light and easy to carry. It's fast and the meter is accurate. I wish the spot meter were easier to access, but that is my only real complaint. It does 90% of what the N80 does at less than half the price. This is a great camera for a new photographer or advanced user looking for a backup film body. The nice thing is all those wide angle lenses stay wide, and shooting a roll of slide film through this little gem will convince you film is not yet dead!	1
When you move the knob up, forward, or backward, the whole device moves off/across the desk. (i.e. It's too light for the resistance of the knob.) I find myself trying to hold the base down with my pinky and ring finger while moving the knob with the others, which is very awkward. This is true even when it's at the most sensitive (fastest) setting. I can't imagine how the lighter laptop version works. I'll be returning it.	0

Well, I certainly don't find this input device very usable. Even after a short time of playing with various programs like Google Earth and SecondLife my hand starts hurting. The problem is mainly that software designers like those at Google demand that in order to use the thing to fly very slowly over a city, your hand needs to constantly press the knob in the lateral direction, where there is the most resistance. It's really hard on the tendons of the hand to sustain that pressure constantly over the course of several minutes.The device is much more usable in the 3d animation suite "Blender." There, you turn the object around only intermittently as you're working... so there's not nearly as much stress on the hands.Another concern is that Linux support is dismal. The drivers which are available on the company's website do not install under Ubuntu Ocelot (11.10)... and I had equally little luck in following all the advice from hobbyists out there who posted on the internet about their attempts to get the thing working with Ubuntu. Linux is fast becoming my main operating system, and so this is a major problem. It does work fine under XP and Win7.All that said, the build quality on the device is exquisite. No complaints there. It has a brushed metal base, the hard rubber knob, and a lot of weight to keep the thing in one place as you press the knob this way and that (it feels like it's made of lead). The knob only moves 1/2 a centimeter to a centimeter in any given direction. It does not twist in circles like you might expect from looking at its design.	0
I've only used one other 35mm SLR before this, which was the Pentax ZX-M.They're both great; No complaints. Love that this camera can use the G lenses I already own for my DSLRs.That's it.	1
I work in 3D graphics programming, and do some modeling once in a while as needed. I was hoping to use this product with Blender, and perhaps our private game level editor. Blender support wasn't there, so that was a bust, and programming for this product wasn't as easy as I was hoping it to be, so, ultimately, for what I needed, it's now been sitting in a drawer for over a year.As a product on it's own, it looks great - well designed, great weight, trendy looking, however, what is that all worth without the software support. If you know for a fact the product will work with the software you want, rely on reviews from people who have used it with what ever that software package is.As for Blender, and Direct-X/C++ game engine integration, it's not a good choice.	0

Don't sound much better than the ones I took out. Not the fault of the speakers just the size and the environment ( an 85' Celica convertible) Although I have an 86' Toyota pickup with the same size speakers and they sound pretty good. Figure that one out.	0
I bought this for my dad. The features are standard for it's class with a major disappointment being a flash sync speed of just 90. The results have been okay to dull. The body has a rugged feel which I liked. The auto light-reading underexposes a bit(that's true with all auto-SLRs of it's class), so I would suggest compensating it +1.5 .I also own a Minolta Maxxum5 which is in the same league but comes with better features and lower price, it produces excellent results consistently. My impression is Nikon is riding more on it's brandname nowadays, rather than leading the field with innovation.My 2c advice for anyone who has decided to go for a Nikon SLR, but has a dilemma in deciding between N80 and N75 - go for N75. You only sacrifice flash sync speed to 90 instead of 125. But the N75 is from more recent technology(incldg light meter) and is much much lighter(which is REALLY IMPORTANT). Out of the Nikon prosumer SLR stable, N75 is the most value for money.If you ask me for a prosumer SLR suggestion between Nikon N75 and Minolta Maxxum5 - hands down Minolta.1/28/09 - The 28-105mm lense is unsharp. N75 as a body may be fine.	1
Fine Picturebut buy a rechargeable  two AA 2500 mah battery setup it takes like ~30 pics before it needs a new set.	0

Do not buy this junk.  Dos  not work. As far as i can tell, none of the wireless motion sensors  work well. I have tried other brands as well.  Either they dont work at all or the oppisite happens.  They are to sens  this results in constant false allarms. No good etheir way.The only motion detecters is find that work well are the standard  120 volt motion detecters you see on flood lights,ect.	0
What a terrific web cam!  Talk about easy to set up.  First make sure you've downloaded Apple's chat software, iChat AV.  After that all you do is pulg the included FireWire cable into the iSight, mount it on your mac and plug the other end into a FireWire port and you're ready to start audio and/or video chats with your AIM buddies.  The one caveat being that you need a high speed connection for video.I love the simplicity and elegance of the iSight.  When I don't want to use the web cam, I don't have to disconnect it, only close the shutter.  But honestly the image and sound quality is such that I never close it down.  I've used several web cams in the past and this one offers by far the best image quality I've seen.  Another small but welcome feature is the iSight's ability to tilt and swivel while mounted to your mac.  Now you can position your web cam just right without a lot of fuss.My only complaint is the need to stick the iSIght mount on you mac.  The mount for notebooks is much better as it just slips over the edge of the screen and doesn't require you to stick anything to your beautiful mac.I've had mine for a few weeks a now and haven't had a single glitch to deal with.  Simple, elegant and high quality.  What more can you ask for?  Did I hear you say a lower price?  Well, you can't have everything right?  : )	1
I've owned two of these for about 1.5 months and the plastic cap that covers the time-delay adjustment wheel on the top is already laced with cracks.  I wouldn't be surprised if it deteriorates enough to leak water into the device after a year or two.  Putting the wheel in the top is the worst location as far as water getting in and I wouldn't be surprised if they hope water gets in so you have to buy a new one every few years.  The head of the screw that holds the battery compartment closed is already 50% covered in rust.My biggest problem is that using two neweneloop NEW 800 mAh Typical, 750 mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 4 pack AAA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesthe motion sensor drains them to 1.36V after a single day and at that point its wireless signal can't reach the X10 wireless receiver that's one story up and about 8 feet back from the wall.  After a month, the batteries are at 1.28V and even the motion sensor on the same story as the receiver is no longer able to get its signal through.  Either that or the distance it picks up motion deteriorates to almost 0 feet.  So, basically, you can't use rechargeable batteries with this motion detector, and I'm not willing to keep feeding it throw-away batteries.For now, I'm running the motion sensors off a 3V plug-in AC adapter I had laying around and they work well like that.  The problem is every time there's a power failure, each motion sensor looses all its settings and defaults to house code A1 when power returns.  With both motion sensors defaulting to A1, it means they both must control the same lights, which is fine for my purposes, but I won't be buying any more of these.The other problem with using an AC adapter is the motion sensors don't work correctly with many of them.  Plus it's very hard to find a 3V AC adapter and even harder to find one that actually puts out 3V.  I went to a garage sale and picked through literally 100 AC adapters and only found 3 or 4 that claimed to be under 3V and they all measured at 6 to 9V!  I had one 3V adapter myself that was specifically designed to replace 3V batteries in a thermostat, and that correctly drives one motion detector.  I tried to use it for both detectors at once but I think the wire is too long and causes voltage fluctuations that cause the motion detector (it happens on both of them) to randomly detect motion that isn't there.  I tried two other AC adapters and the false motion detection was much worse.  I tried reducing the voltage using diodes and using two resistors but the problem remains.  I also tried a number of capacitors in parallel to filter noise and they seemed to help but didn't cure the problem.I ended up buying on oscilloscope (have always wanted one) and it shows the motion detectors start to fail when voltage fluctuates as little as 15mV.  I used the scope to find that a 5V Macintosh USB AC wall adapter (a tiny one less than an inch square so it must use a switching power supply which is good for efficiency) had no measurable voltage fluctuation so I used a 33ohm and 47ohm resistor (look up "voltage divider") to drop it to 3V and it runs the second motion detector without false detection.  Note that if you use a much larger resistor the motion detector starts malfunctioning (can't draw enough current through the resistor, I think), and if you use a much smaller resistor then it lets current leak through it constantly even when the motion detector isn't connected and it heats up (wasting power constantly and will probably fail).Rather than buying these cheap motion detectors and a high-quality AC adapter, I recommend getting a motion detector that runs on a 9V battery because rechargeable 9Vs last a lot longer and have voltages closer to their throw-away counterparts.  Insteon motion sensors are twice as expensive, but they remember their settings, run on 9V, and don't have any cheap rubber-like covers that will deteriorate and let water in.  I've been running three of them on a 9V rechargeable for the last 5 months without recharging and they're still turning on the lights when I walk by.  They also come with an arm you can swivel the detector on instead of screwing flat to the wall (important for limiting their range by tilting down or making sure sun doesn't shine directly on the motion sensor) and you can snap them off the arm for easy battery replacement.  Their battery compartment is also much easier to open.Update: I finally thought I'd gotten these detectors working reliably on AC power when a heavy wind storm caused the deck lights to turn on.  I tracked it down in my MisterHouse automation logs to one of these detectors and unplugged it so we could sleep, only to have the lights turn on again after I got in bed.  Logs showed the other detector had also seen the wind as motion so I unplugged it too.  Logs show a third Insteon 9V motion detector never saw the wind as motion and it was also pointed at things moving in the wind.  I also discovered that the Insteon motion detectors see false motion when you set them on the ground, but not when you mount them off the ground.  Moving the X10 sensors up higher also seems to help, but they still see wind as motion occasionally.	0
What a terrific web cam!  Talk about easy to set up.  First make sure you've downloaded Apple's chat software, iChat AV.  After that all you do is pulg the included FireWire cable into the iSight, mount it on your mac and plug the other end into a FireWire port and you're ready to start audio and/or video chats with your AIM buddies.  The one caveat being that you need a high speed connection for video.I love the simplicity and elegance of the iSight.  When I don't want to use the web cam, I don't have to disconnect it, only close the shutter.  But honestly the image and sound quality is such that I never close it down.  I've used several web cams in the past and this one offers by far the best image quality I've seen.  Another small but welcome feature is the iSight's ability to tilt and swivel while mounted to your mac.  Now you can position your web cam just right without a lot of fuss.My only complaint is the need to stick the iSIght mount on you mac.  The mount for notebooks is much better as it just slips over the edge of the screen and doesn't require you to stick anything to your beautiful mac.I've had mine for a few weeks a now and haven't had a single glitch to deal with.  Simple, elegant and high quality.  What more can you ask for?  Did I hear you say a lower price?  Well, you can't have everything right?  : )	1
i got one of these cause i wanted a little extra bass and wow did i get it. had it hooked up to a 250 watt rms amp to only one voice coil and that was great but then i upgraded to a 1000watt rms amp to bolth voice coils and i will shook windows as i drove by. but after a while it seemed to get quieter and then stopped i took it out and inspected it and saw the voice coil wires were melted and separated.	0
This little camera really adds a new dimension to the internet.  Of course, on the mac, you just plug the thing in and it works flawlessly.  The ability to have one-way video conferences or just audio conferences makes it nice too.  The microphone really does a good jobThe mounts appear to be rather permanent once the backing is removed, so watch out!	1
I purchased the Picture Porter Elite because I needed a replacement for my old iPod-camera connector setup to back up photos on travel. The company (Digital Foci) seems to have a broad following in the digital photography community based on its Photo Safe product, which does the same thing as the Picture Porter Elite but without an LCD screen. I thought that springing for the LCD screen would be a big plus so that I could view the photos instead of "trusting" that the unit backed up the photos from the camera's memory card.The first thing I noticed after receiving the Picture Porter Elite was the size and weight of the unit itself. My wife commented also on this - "that's going in your carryon luggage, not mine". After turning it on and futzing around with it, my impression didn't improve very much. The LCD screen wasn't as high-res as other PVPs, and the menu system was rather clunky.In the end, although next to the Wolverine units it had the best price/storage size ratio for storing and viewing digital photos, it didn't seem worth it to take up precious luggage space with the Picture Porter Elite, especially considering its substantial heft and rather limited functionality. It may appeal a lot more to dedicated photo enthusiasts who won't mind lugging it along in order to reliably preserve their photos. Since Apple hasn't seen fit to create a new camera connector for their latest generation iPods, I'll probably end up springing for a Creative Zen or other similar product that has good multimedia capabilities and a built-in SD card reader to back up photos.	0

keyboard quality is very low : high key resistance + no click feedback result in numerous typing mistakes - DO NOT BUY	0
Great camera. Great integration with Macs and Panther (I have upgraded). But I agree with the previous reviewer. When you spend this much on a web cam, the software absolutely should be included. Another major misstep by Apple trying Microsoft tactics. Anothger major con is the inability of iChatAV to integrate with other commercial web cam software. A pro? What many people don't know is that a regular firewire digital camera can be used as a high end camera with iChatAV as well!	1
I was totally disappointed with this purchase.I thinks this item was DOA (Dead on Arrival). Amazon should audit their sellers. I opened this keyboard after returning from a month and a half business trip. I tried to install it with my Dell Inspiron 6000 and it did not work. I restarted my system thinking that it will be recognized at the bois level. But it still did not work. I hope the seller will allow me to return close to two months.	0

Dell's laptop was ok.  But I replaced two keyboards...and don't bother blaming the 10 or so spilled Blatz that I doused it with.  That's just normal wear and tear (in these parts).	0
Pros:- Excellent audio and video performances- Mounts to Apple's LCD and notebook displays- Excellent built quality (aluminum-alloy construction)- Beautiful design- Supports AOL, .Mac, Rendezvous (all via iChat AV), and Yahoo! via Yahoo! Messenger for OS XCons:- Very expensive- Adhesive mounting kit for LCD display- No video chat for MSN (which is Microsoft's fault, but still)- Does not include video capture application- Works only on Mac OS X (at least for now)- iChat AV costs extra (beta which expires on 12/31/2003 is free) for OS X 10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; users (included with OS X 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot; at no cost, however)Apple's iSight is among the most expensive webcam out there. If you are heavily into video conferencing, however, the decision should be no brainer. iSight is THE webcam to own.First of all, iSight is one of the few webcams to use FireWire 400 bus. FireWire not only provides plenty of bandwidth for VGA quality video and audio (24-bit 640x480 at 30 frames per second), iSight gets all the power from it, too.Rotate the lens cap, which opens and closes the lens, and iSight comes alive (it will also activate iChat AV). Both audio and video capture performance are superb, with excellent exposure and clear audio. It is easily the best performing webcam out there.And the built quality and design... simply stunning. Made in sturdy aluminum-alloy (used by 12&quot; and 17&quot; PowerBook G4 as well as PowerMac G5), iSight feels expensive. Furthermore, iSight is very functionally designed. Although mounting on Apple's LCD display requires adhesive (sticky) mounting stand, mounting on Apple's portable computer is elegant (even comes with a carrying case).So is it worth a buy? iSight is certainly the best webcam out there. But it's also the most expensive and works only under Mac OS X. If you have lots of buddies on AOL (or .Mac) and Yahoo!'s Instant Messaging network, and wants to impress with high quality audio and video, iSight is worth the money. Otherwise, it probably won't get used often enough to warrant very high price tag.	1
I had this for about a year before the connections started going bad.  It was always stored in a rack case in an air conditioned building and only used once a month.  Bad connections after one year would seem to indicate poor build quality.	0

After reading all the other reviews, I expected this to be high quality. I missed the review that suggested that this was for a more "static" situation (ie... dont take it on the road)...Well, in my case, I didnt even get out of the kitchen. I unpacked the cable and noticed that the very slim cables going into the back of the XLR connectors did not have any visible strane relief. It seemed very sloppy... but, unhindered, I thought maybe it was just a "look" and I could get over that.When I went to actually plug this into my FocusRite Firewire Pro and into my mics, I found that several (at least 3) did not work... others did, but with only 5 out of 8 working, it wasnt a good sign. Not sure what would have happened if I actually tried to take this on the road and actually use it.Lesson learned... you get what you pay for... If you are going to use this in a "static" situation... ie... you have it in a fixed studio, and if you dont mind repairing the solder connections when you move it, then this is the inexpensive setup for you. Otherwise, consider another product... I have returned mine to get my money back... you can have it.	0
I've had the iSight for a while now, and for the most part, I've been very pleased with it.First, the bad.  The biggest drawback is that, thus far, I have not been able to do an AV chat from my Mac with someone using AOL's AV IM client on Windows -- whenever I've tried this, both I and the person I'm trying to connect to get error messages wrongly stating that our cams are not connected.  Others have not had this problem.  I do recognize that AV instant messaging is in its infancy, so it is probably safe to assume that this situation will improve with time.Second, the camera does not include any software (not even the iChat AV client for which it is designed).  Other webcams include more generous software offerings -- and at a lower price, which brings me to...Third, the price.  The iSight is among the most expensive webcams available.  If you're on a budget, you would do well to take a look at several other webcams and compare features and reviews before deciding on an iSight.All that being said, however, the iSight is quite a camera.  It is small, lightweight, and unobtrusive, especially with the &quot;all in one&quot; cable.  The three included mounts make it very versatile -- if you go with another camera, you're likely to find yourself needing to buy additional mounts from third party vendors.  It is also aesthetically pleasing, if that makes any difference to you, as it does to me... a lot of other webcams are pretty unattractive.The autofocus feature has always worked nearly flawlessly for me, whether the cam is on my lap or across the room -- its ability to &quot;find&quot; me and focus on me is almost eerie.  The picture is also very good.  Others, including Macworld, have said they encountered trouble in low light, but I have not had this problem.  I typically use the cam in my living room, with a single 150-watt bulb lighting the room from about two meters away, and the picture is fine.  I've even sent images by candlelight that looked good (albeit only at pretty close range).The iSight can also be used to make sound and video files, and while it obviously doesn't offer the power or versatility of a digital camcorder, it's still a pretty good tool for this task as well, especially when used with Apple's QuickTime Broadcaster (a free download) and iMovie.If the iSight were about thirty dollars less and included more software, I'd have given it five stars.  Apart from those caveats, though, this is an excellent camera, and one well worth your consideration.	1
What can one say about a mouse that has a wheel that feels like it's missing a few gears - every time I use it feels like it needs a new transmission.This mouse is about as responsive as a 25 year old jackass donkey coming around a mountain pass at 2 to 3 mph on a gravel road.In short this is garbage.This is one of the those purchases that won't even be worth taking a drive up to UPS or the post office to return - less of a hassle just to throw it out and eat the 6 dollar loss.That should tell you something - don't YOU buy this POS and put yourself in the same boat.	0

Well, another 6 bucks up a pig's rear end.  Delivered promptly. Good looking exterior. Bought to replace an old Logitech mouse iwth ball and switches.Plugged it into the PS/2 socket on my computer.  The lighted wheel lit up.  The laser lit up, and then.....nothing.It does not work...AT ALL.  Six bucks is too cheap to ship back, so I guess I will eat it. Too bad I cannot give it NO STARS, because it did not give me anything.	0
True video conferencing - the type that has been promised for years now really exists and is affordable for the common man (and woman). All you need is a firewire Mac (all new Macs for the past 4 years have shipped w/ firewire, but you can always install an after-market firewire PCI card if needed) running OS 10.2 or better, iChat/AV (Apple's software that comes free with OS 10.3 - &quot;Panther&quot;), and a broadband connection.There are many iChat related Web sites that contain databases of other iSight owners, so you can always find someone to chat with, even if none of your friends have Macs or broadband connections.The camera can also be used for Yahoo Chat, but Yahoo's software limits your video to snapshot slide shows. iChat/AV allows you to to have live streaming video and audio with full duplexing, so it's like you're on the phone.If you have a bad hair day, you can use the microphone only so you don't have to share the video. The lens cap is built-in, and with a simple twist of the lens, your camera is turned off.The camera is an elegant addition to your Mac goodies, although the mounting has much to be desired. Some third-party companies have come out with some excellent alternatives for mounting the iSight, however, if you don't have a laptop to clip it to and you don't want to &quot;stick&quot; it on your monitor.The camera is in full color and will automatically focus from about 1&quot; to infinity. My less than perfect rating is for two reasons - 1 being the aforementioned mounting options - tacky &quot;stick-on&quot; mounting isn't the choice for most and the laptop clip can be broken easily during transport.  My biggest gripe is the white balancing of the camera. This might be eventually corrected w/ a new version of the iChat software, but for now, the color you see is not necessarily reflecting reality. I have my computer next to a window, so in the middle of a sunny day with my overhead light on, the color looks great. At night (no ambient sunlight) with an overhead light, the colors are grainy and flat.If you hold a white piece of paper next to your face while you look at yourself on the camera, the color suddenly corrects, but goes back to awful the minute you put the paper down.Traditional cameras with built-in light meters have an ability to &quot;spot meter&quot; and lock a light meter reading - Apple needs to put this option in with their next incarnation of iChat/AV.  For now, I have 2 halogen desk lamps on either side of my monitor. When I chat w/ someone in the evening, I will turn on the hot white lights to illuminate my face so the other person doesn't think they're talking to Darth Vader or the Grim Reaper.I used it a couple of times for audio-only chats - the microphone quality is superb. I have chatted to people in Canada, Israel and Australia without a noticable delay or degredation in quality. If the other user is using a built-in microphone in lieu of an iSight, however, they will probably hear you well, but you may have a hard time hearing them.I have also used the camera for some video/audio chats with people from around the globe. There is a noticable 1 second time difference delay, but it is acceptable all things considered.As with all things Apple, this camera is quite an innovation.  Beforehand, there was only one other firewire camera on the market and it did not allow for live streaming video. Thanks to Apple's iChat software, however, you can use some other cameras, but I would not recommend it. With the few failings of iSight, it is still the best there is - and considering what it does, it's well worth the price.	1
It's nice that it auto switches, but my devices would frequently lose HDCP sync with the tv.  That means you've got to turn off all your devices, the tv, and remove power from the switch to reset it.  This switch is now collecting dust in a box in my garage for this reason.	0

Nice and small package with auto switching ... only if you have the right stuff.  Hitachi HD, Sony DVR and an Xbox 360 Elite ... no way will it work with any of it.After over 19 minutes with two different customer support people, all they could tell me was I should upgrade the firm ware on the Sony DVR and the Xbox was only now going through the testing stages.  There is a handshaking that has to go from the TV and the HDMI components to activate the auto switch.  If it times out too quickly, the box will not switch.  Doesn't even switch with the remote.I was hoping for an auto switch, but not this one.  If you decide to go with this unit, make absolutely sure all of your components are new and HDMI V1.3 with the most recent firmware.	0
It set up right away with Face Time but I've had some trouble getting it to work with Skype. Hopefully, I'll figure that out soon. Clean, neat little camera, matches the rest of the mac products, tiny by gives a great picture.	1
Quite a few bad reviews here. I have to say, I have had no issues! Picked it up, plugged it in, absolutely no headache. The unit is connected to a Scientific Atlanta HD cable box and a Sony DVD player. The unit quickly switches between active HDMI sources when different inputs are selected. I have this unit behind a cabinet and am running a Logitech Harmony 890 (also very happy with). The auto sensing feature is what sold me on this unit.I GAVE IT ONE STAR, HOWEVER I MEANT TO GIVE IT FIVE (Couldn't change)	0

The auto switch logic in this unit creates a major problem when used with a DirecTV DVR.Apparently the switch looks for a constant HDMI source.  In the case of a DirecTV DVR, when you switch from one channel to another, for a brief moment there is no HDMI signal.  The IOGear HDMI switch therefore switches off that source, but does not switch back to it when the DVR starts sending out a good HDMI signal again.  So now the DVR is no longer displaying on the TV, nothing is.  It gets very tiring to have to use the remote to get the switch to work again.  And even with a new battery, the remote has a very short range, so often I have to get up and walk over to the switch and hit the physical button on the unit.Yes, it does work with constant HDMI sources like a DVD player, but don't buy this switch if you plan to use it with a DirecTV receiver or DVR.I would much prefer a switch without automatic switching logic.  Ideally it would just stay on the selected source until I request a new source with the remote.	0
This camera is built like a tank. It has excellent quality video. My MacMini installed the driver and some nice software, and the little camera works flawlessly with Yahoo messenger.  I bought the little camera brand new in non original packaging for $42.00 bucks shipped and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Apple got it right with this little USB Webcam.  Just plug it in and start using it within a minute or two right out of the box.	1

...AGAIN!I realize the soul of this county has been sold to China, I get that. The vast majority of EVERYTHING has been outsourced by greedy SOBs that don't care what cost their actions take on us, its the bottom line...I get that as well.But this is the second piece of junk that I've gotten in a week, and now I know what not to do...NEVER BUY ANYTHING DIRECTLY FROM CHINA EVER AGAIN!I've got a piece of garbage iPhone clone (what a mistake that was...the real one is coming soon), and now this.This thing was basically just a little USB plug with a little section for the card...the USB plug is the wrong size! It will not fit into a USB plug! How can they screw that up?! The one I got is not even branded! Its a copy!I'm sure that the distributor will gladly have me send a 50 piece of garbage half way around the world (at a cost of 5x what the thing is worth), but hey, its too late, I've already thrown it in the trash.I'm only buying local from now on...this was a good lesson!	0

When this item worked, it was fine.  Easy to use.  Compact.  Sadly, it literally fell apart in my hands soon after arriving.  It was only a few dollars, but still, it should have lasted a lot longer than a few days.  I was surprised at the poor quality, as I have not had any problems with other Kingston products.	0
I bought the GMini 220 because the of the features for the price (I wanted the compact flash interface to transfer pictures). I have had it a week. The unit is compact and sturdy. The user interface is usable but not fantastic. It plays well and I like it. Transferring files is easy (although I don't like the Musicmatch Jukebox software very much, I just copy the files on).One Small annoyance is that to use headphones other than the ones which came with it, you need a small external adapter (which comes with it).I haven't tried to transfer pictures to it yet.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.	1
I bought this mainly for the usb adapter part. However, it is very fragile. The string is only attached by a tiny bend of metal attached to the USB device. The string has bent off several times and I'm afraid the metal hook the string attaches to, may shortly break off due to excessive bending. Also, The black plastic shell is useless when sticking it into a USB slot. you have to separate the plastic shell from the device to make plugging it in easier. I have a dell Studio and it is slightly difficult to stick into any of the slots. But when it is inserted, it reads quickly and I have not had an issue reading it in any device I stick it in.So if you are buying it for the USB adapter part, find another solution if you don't want to hassle with a fragile device. That's why I came back online today, to find an alternative device.	0

I bought this to connect a video phone to my computer since this one doesn't do wifi. It didn't work and when I researched how to make my pc share internet connection...either its not feasible or just too complicated.	0
Well, I won't claim this is a perfect product, I have usediPod 20GB, Creative Zen Extra 40gb, iRiver PMP-140(40GB),iRiver H10 5GB/20GB. By far I consider archos is thebest among all.I don't like iPod or Creative. Don't get me wrong, they arefind products, but I just hate the way they organize themusic purly by the information stored inside the MP3 files.I like to organize my songs by directories and sub-directories,and maybe sub-directories under sub-directories, just like ahard drive. But in iPod and Creative I feel like all my albumsare spreaded all over the table, I have to scroll down severalpages to locate an album. Not to mention the information storedinside the songs is not always accurate. In some languages,the same word can have different codes. Like chinese has Big5and GB, so the same singer published by TaiWan and Mainlandchina will appear under two names! And the two names are notalways together!I had huge problem with iRiver PMP-140. The damn thing automaticallyswitch between play and fast forward, it doesn't play 192 bit.Finally I had to return it.iRiver H10 5GB is a nice product, but a little too expensiveconsidering its small disk size, and it doesn't connect to PCsmoothly, some day it gets connected with no problem, some dayit doesn't, there are weird ways to solve the problem on internet,just google it.iRiver H10 20GB is OK, but transferring songs is super slow,especially on a celeron processor, plus, the battery is notinterchangable, and you can't just plug it in any computerand expect it to be connected -- you need to log in as anadministrator to install software, This is going to be aproblem for people like me who doesn't have administratorprivilege on a office PC.OK, so how do I like this Archos 220? First, the compact flashcard reader is the best! I am a photo enthusiast. I take tonsof photos with my Nikon D70. With gmini 220, I literally takewith me a 20GB harddisk! I can transfer my photos to the Gmini220 anytime I want. Got memory stick? no problem, buy the 4-in-1compact flash card adaptor and you are good to go! Don't trustthe so called "USB-on-the-fly" thing, First you to carry a cableor a card reader with you, second it doesn't work with all cameras,Third, most "USB-on-the-fly" supports only USB1.1 host, the transferspeed is terribly slow. I tried the one on that iRiver PMP-140, itliterally takes 15 seconds to transfer one picture file -- you willprobably run out of battery before you finish transferring files.On my Gmini 220, One 3Mb photo takes less than 1 second. I spent avacation to Vegas and Grand Canyon a few weeks ago, where I took over1GB photos, all photos were transferred to my gmini220 and carriedback safely, no problem at all!I also like the way gmini connects to PC: no software required,no installation, no need to log in as an administrator. When youconnect to a PC, it becomes a hard drive automatically. copyingfiles to 220 is just like copying files from one disk to another.I did have connection problem on one of my older Dell PC, but itconnects perfectly on my all other newer PCs and laptops. Accordingto archos website, they suggest you to upgrade BIOS, I yet to trythat out.It has dual organization methods of your music library. You canbrowse your music files through directory structure, just like whatyou would do on a PC hard drive, or, if you prefer, you can use ARClibrary, which is similar to windows Media player, search your libraryby singer, album etc.The screen of gmini220 is bigger than other MP3 players, although itis black/while, but I found it is very practical, I've never wantedto view my photo or video in a tiny little screen, why do I needa color screen?But as I said, it is not perfect. here are something that I thinkarchos should improve:1 The factory-installed battery really sucks, they should use highercapacity battery and make it interchangable2 There is ZERO customer serivce, they don't reply your email and theirphone line is always busy3 No carrying case, my screen got scratched the 2nd day I got it.4 It's a little bit ugly, not a main issue for guys like me, butprobably your girl friend won't like it.5 If only it is 40GB ...6 It does support Asia languages like Chinese, but you can displyeither GB or Big5, not both. That is annoying but not a disaster,some Big5 characters still gets displayed correctly under GB system(vice verse).Overall I like the gmini 220 and would recommend it to any of my friends.I did hear a lot of complaint about this unit on internet, but strangely,I personally have no problem with mine at all, probably I am lucky? don'tknow, will report later if I encounter problems.	1
Having invested many thousands in body and lenses, I am stuck with a non-functioning camera that seems to have a design problem in the electronics.  I am sincerely hoping that I am wrong but feel pretty disappointed right now.  Specifically the camera shuts down with certain lenses in temperatures below 40 degrees (F). I have installed several firmware updates and returned it for repair but so far the problems are not resolved.Update: the problems have now been resolved - the performance of the camera is exceptional at this price point.	0

Do not recommend.  Problem SATA Drives have to use adaptor option which did not work properly slower transfer rate, this enclosure is made for older IDE drives. Unit made in China.	0
I have a problem with ear buds- this product give great sound easy to wear - has the volume control and the price is hard to beat.	1
First count:  when run with an EIDE (or PATA) hard drive, this unit does not run like an external USB drive.  Specifically, if you start the computer with the drive already running it will not mount the hard drive.  You have to boot up your computer and then start the Acomdata external drive. This is not like an integral external USB drive which starts when the computer starts, sleeps ("stands by") when the computer sleeps, et cetera.  If you forget and left it running while you restarted your computer after installing Windows security updates, for example, you have to shut the computer down, turn off the drive, reboot the computer, and then turn on the Acomdata external drive.  In other words, it is a pain, and a disappointment for those of us who thought we could covert large EIDE hard drives we had from previous computers into convenient backup storage via a makeshift external USB hard drive for our new SATA computers.Second count:  no technical help.  I contacted Acomdata to see if the EIDE drive issue, above, was normal or if there was something wrong with my particular unit.  They collected my contact information twice, and I don't know why they bothered, because literally a week later I have yet to get contacted by anyone.Third count:  Although this unit does work like an integral external USB drive when a SATA hard drive is installed, it lacks the quality, performance, and value for the money of other choices available on Amazon.com.  In particular, the "Thermaltake N0012USU"Thermaltake N0012USU Max 4 Active Cooling 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 eSATA Hard Drive Enclosureoffers both USB and eSATA, a cooling fan, an included eSATA adapter kit from your computer, and a much more rugged, durable, and secure internal hard drive interface, and all this comes for less than 50% more cost than the Acomdata unit.  The eSATA interface is much faster and still goes into and out of Windows sleep mode.  The adapter kit includes a SATA cable to run from a spare SATA port on your motherboard to a slot plate which has a SATA to eSATA connector feeding through it, and then an eSATA cable to run from that connector on the rear of your computer to the hard disk drive (it also has a longer USB cable than comes with the Acomdata).  The fan obviously keeps it cooler.  The eSATA adapter looks a lot like Amazon.com's "Cables To Go 13423"Cables To Go 13423 Serial ATA to External Serial ATA Dual Port Adapter (Nickel)except that it has only one cable - so you see that this adapter is worth about $11 more in price than the Acomdata all by itself and that $11 accounts for most of the $14 price difference between the two units.  Thermaltake does not service EIDE drives but then neither does the Acomdata for practical purposes, as noted above.	0

I'm so disappointed! All these good reviews for this thing, and it doesn't work right. Let me say here that I tried it with my HP desktop and Dell laptop and get exactly the same results. Specifically:I hooked it up per the instructions, turned it on, and... nothing. The computer didn't even see it. So I unplugged the USB cable and when I plugged it back in, the computer saw it and it came up. Great! Turned it off, turned it back on... nothing.After MUCH experimentation I found that the drive must be powered on BEFORE being plugged in to the computer, which is not only contrary to the instructions, it's just stupid. It means you either have to let the drive spin constantly (stupid) or you have to disconnect the drive from the computer every time you turn it off (again, stupid).If you leave the drive spinning, you can connect and disconnect the USB cable all you want, it recognizes it every time.Makes no difference whether or not you properly unmount the drive before turning if off.All the good things people have said about the instructions and the ease of putting it together are true but it doesn't really matter because as far as I'm concerned, this is a deal-breaker. I've written to Acomdata and will wait for their response but unless they have a REALLY GOOD idea, this enclosure is going back.Update 6-16-10.Several reviews here have mentioned that the jumper had to be set to CS, not master as the instructions say. That was my problem. After I changed the jumper, it works perfectly.The Acomdata support people obviously don't know about this; they told me to send the drive back. Instead, I remembered about the jumper and tried it. It works great now. (I have told them about it, but don't look for them to re-print their instruction manuals.)Why am I leaving my rating at 1 star? If I hadn't found out about the jumper, I'd have sent the drive back ($$), probably gotten another one which, of course, wouldn't have worked either, then sent it back. (More $$) If my 1 star rating makes people look at this review, it can save some people a lot of trouble.	0
These are a decent set of headphones for the money.  I can't speak for others, but they sound good to me.  I also recommend the headphone case.	1
I only turned this drive on once a month to back up my system. The 10th time I turned it on it was dead. It was plugged directly into my UPS so it couldn't have been a surge. I've gone off-site backup since and never looked back. This was a terrible purchase.	0

I recently bought several of these.  At first I was very happy with the them.  The build quality seemed very nice, they were solid.Then I noticed the heat, it wasn't significant but it was enough for me to take a closer look.  The drives never spun down!  I asked acomdata tech support about it and never received a response.  I was concerned this could lead to premature failure, not to mention the extra heat added to the room and higher power usage.I ended up returning them all and purchased another brand.Also, just a minor gripe, the blue LEDs on the front were INSANELY bright.  I had to either point them away or put electrical tape over the light, which is what I did.  Even then, a surprising amount of blue light made it's way through the vents and illuminated the room at night.	0
The first set I received had a problem with the sound.  One side was louder than the other.  I contacted Amazon and they had a replacement set sent to me ASAP.  All I had to do was re-box the defective set and use the label I printed they provided and drop it off at no cost.  I am using the new ones as I type.  The sound is good and volume button is in the right spot, very handy.	1
What a nightmare. I will keep this short and sweet.Windows Vista is a disaster. The computer finds it almost impossible to connect to wireless networks with more than one access point. Stability issues in 3D games such as World of Warcraft and Doom III have yet to be resolved. The sound card has, without warning, disappeared and required a driver re-install three times.And now, just as it enters the twilight of its 1-year warranty, one of the hard drives has failed. This wouldn't be a problem, since the Amazon receipt clearly shows the computer still within warranty, but, and here's the kicker, HP DOES NOT accept Amazon receipts. This last, unacceptable, unforgivable problem is what makes me give this computer one star as opposed to two.So, in my opinion, you have the option of either not buying this computer at all, or buying it elsewhere, but buying on Amazon is not an option for HP products. Honestly, after a bad warranty experience, I would recommend not buying it at all.	0

The HP M9040N Elite appears to have the right mix of parts upon first inspection of the technical specifications, but the overall product is a disappointment at the performance level. I have a year old Dell Inspiron 530 Core2Quad that can run circles around the HP M9040N. I really don't know why because the proprietary HP (Asus) motherboard is better (my opinion) than the proprietary Dell (Foxconn) motherboard. So the difference must lie in the system BIOS software handling of the chipset.After wiping the shovel-wares and optimizing the desktops for best performance, the HP M9040N was still dismal in comparison to the Dell Inspiron 530 Desktop. The Vista Experience Level was also different, 4.9 for the HP, 5.1 for the Dell. Both desktops were running Vista32 home premium, same amount of DDR2 RAM, same graphics adapter, have same size SATA drives, same Intel G33 chipset.I know the Vista Experience Level and / or Seat of the Pants observations do not quantify the performance of a system, but those are all I had to go by, and when the difference is noticeable to the user, there WILL BE a huge difference in the benchmarks. Hands down the Dell is faster, however the retail pricing is not the same either.If the discounted price difference between the two aforementioned desktop computers is $100USD or less, then the choice is a no-brainer.	0
Bought this because I needed a pair of headphones to wrap behind the head (remember to wear a helme when you're cycling, kids!), that also had a volume control, and that were cheap enough to not miss if they got broken.This headphones have an interesting feature -- the ears sort of fold up to form this horizontally smaller setup for travel -- it's not particularly useful in practice, but it is a nice thought.They are a little tight around my head yet do not hurt after extended (2 hour) use, but YMMV.As for the sound -- you will need to tweak the EQ if you have one on your player. They are naturally fairly cheap, and so you don't expect good sound, but they really seem to blast the mid-high range, sometimes in an almost painful fashion. Lowering the mid-highs, and upping the bass and treble solves it for me. This is why I'm rating it a 3, for the unbalanced sound. I've had other similar products (my last set) which, while the sound isn't great, reproduce it fairly evenly across the board.Other than that, if you need a pair of cheap headphones to work out with, with a volume control, that wrap around your head, these are the ones to get.	1
I was very disappointed with my computer and the service.  I was told that if I paid extra for "premium" service or new premium software the computer would work as promised.Many of the multimedia functions the computer advertises either do not work or require advanced knowledge for which users have to pay a hefty fee (HP tech support refuses to help).  For example, I paid extra for the premium version of the Roxio software.  The premium version does not come close to doing everything I expected.  If I really want the software to work I will have to pay extra.In addition HP's tech support is truly pathetic.  I have called twice.  Before I can even finish describing the problem the technical support person instructed me to reinstall the operating system.  No diagnosis.  No try this, then try that.  Just reinstall the operating system.  I could get technical support like that from my computer illiterate grandmother.When HP says they are going to stand behind their product I expect technical support to be more knowledgable and insightful than simply to say reinstall the operating system.I eventually figured out how to solve the problems on my own.  Now I know that calling technical support is just a waste of time.  I will not bother with it in the future.  I would advise against paying extra for extended years of so-called "technical support".	0

Got the m9080n yesterday, unboxed it, hooked all cables, switched it on and....nothing! Just a very loud noise coming from the unit, like something very bad was happening.No signal to the monitor. Called HP and was told they would send me a new power supply. Give me a break ! I am not a handyman and don't want to open the PC.They suggested I could take it to a CompUSA for repair, under warranty of course. I did it and now I'm waiting to see if it can be fixed quickly or will return it. Where is HP quality control ? At least they should make sure it boots. Frustrating and annoying.When and if I get a working machine I will post a decent review, hopefully giving it a 5 stars.Update: Can't be fixed without new part. Just returned it for a replacement.Update-2 Got the new machine from Amazon. Installation went well with the exception of no audio from the Realtek soundcard. After few hours installing new drivers and changing settings, the audio came. Not a HP fault, just this dreadful buggy Vista. Overall, everything is fine now.5 stars to Amazon. Shipping was reinbursed and new machine came in 2 days air. Great service !	0
I have been using this model of wireless router since January 2005, and have not experienced the problems that some others seem to have had. (The DI-784, along with our DSL modem and other equipment, is connected to an uninterruptible power supply for protection from "power nasties" such as surges, brownouts, etc.).Used in conjunction with a D-Link DWL-AG530 PCI card, my wife's PC has 108 Mbps connectivity using 802.11a (Super A with Static Turbo selected). I recently carried out a single continuous transfer of 340 Gigabytes of data from PC to PC without a hiccup from the router.The 802.11g band (Super G without Turbo selected) is used by her HP DeskJet 6840 printer.The PC and printer are installed in another room across a hallway from the router, and do not have direct line of sight for the signal. I have found that the best signal strength is obtained by installing the router up high (on a bookcase) with the antenna extended straight up. Signal strength on the PC hovers at around 70%.For Static Turbo to work on the DI-784, the XR (eXtended Range) setting on the DWL-AG530 must be disabled. Also, Super G with Dynamic Turbo mode only operates on 802.11g channel 6.FYI. I'm also using firmware version 2.40, and channel 1 for 802.11g (my neighbor is already using channel 6, which is the default for most routers/access points).	1
I receive an error message when trying to use the card on my HP5180 printer and my LG VX8100 cell phone. I have to send it back.	0

Like many others, I read all the glowing reviews of these headphones (and others made by Denon) and made the plunge.  When I first got them, I was rather unimpressed, but I knew they needed a little burn-in time.  I gave them about a 48 hour burn-in and they did improve significantly, especially the bass.  But is it good enough to justify the price tag?  I don't think so.  For the record, I'm using them with a Cowon S9 portable media player, which is known for its high quality audio output; as well as lossless music files in FLAC format.The bass, like everyone has said, is pretty good.  Not amazing, but they do have an impressive kick to them given the small size.  The mids are also pretty good.  Where these headphones fail is in the highs.  High notes from guitars, cymbals, pianos, etc create a piercing sound that makes me cringe like that of fingernails on a chalkboard.  It's not that bad at low volumes but at medium-high volumes it's very annoying.They fit my ears pretty well using the standard medium earpads, but the headphones only sound good if you're able to create a suction in your ear canal, and it's sometimes hard to get that suction.  Slight movements of the cord can easily break the suction which results in me having to constantly readjust them.  Like others have said, the weight of the connector on the extension cord tugs on them, which frequently causes the headphones to break suction.  Denon definitely should have included a shirt clip for the cord.  The main cord connected to the headphones is only long enough to reach a shirt pocket (about 1.5-2 feet long), anything longer needs the extension.These things do block outside sound pretty well.  I work at a large datacenter where we are normally required to wear earplugs (sounds like a small jet engine in the server rooms).  These headphones block sound out almost as well as the earplugs do, which is nice.All-in-all, they aren't bad headphones.  They sound as clear as my $100 BOSE in-ear headphones but with better bass.  If it wasn't for the poorly produced highs and the heavy cord, these would be great.  I'm still not sure if I want to keep mine or not.*** UPDATE (3/15/2010) ***Just thought I would drop by and add to my review now that I have owned my Denons for about 6 months.  They are holding up fantastically.  I basically just ball them up and stick them in my pocket while I'm running around all day at work.. constantly taking them in and out of my pocket.  I figured the cord would have worked itself loose from the buds by now, but they're putting up well with my abuse.  The black finish started wearing off after just a few weeks, and now they are half silver/aluminum, half black.  Durability gets a B+ from me.  The excessive weight of the extension cord connector has really gotten on my nerves.. I reached a point where I've been safety pinning the cord to my shirt at the start of every work day because the weight of it was pulling them out of my ears.  And that happens sitting down, not moving.  Any movement/walking makes it 10x worse.. borderline impossible to keep in my ears.  I've lowered my review from 3 to 2 stars, and can confidently say I'd never buy these again, even if they were $20.Hope this helps.	0
I have had this router for about 12 months now and it has worked perfect. I run on the A network and stream Media Center content to my extender (Lynksys and Xbox 360) and it works great. I also connect my laptop daily on my wireless network with no issues there either. It has so pretty advanced firewall features that have worked great for me.	1
The sound quality was good but none of the ear cushions would stay in my ears unless I stood or sat absolutely still. This problem was exacerbated by the totally illogical cord and extension design. The earphones come with a ridiculously short cord and a longer extension. The connection between the two adds extra weight that pulls down on the earphones, making them more prone to coming out of the ear.	0

This arrived on time (2 days actually) and in very good shape.  The box was H-U-G-E and protected it well.Can't comment as to the antenna, waiting on the radio tune now...I expect this will be outstanding setup._____________________________________________________________10/17/2012Well, not so good.  After installing this antenna, it blew out the final stage of my CB unit.  Totally fried the setup.  And yes, it was setup correctly.  Very disappointed as now I have to get another unit.  I'm moving on to another antenna.  NOte that this is not a seller problem, but rather a product problem.	0
I won't echo the praises in other reviews that helped me select this lens as my next purchase.  I'm just an amateur who has taken a few classes; not a pro.  A lifetime Pentax person, I took some awesome wildflower shots recently with my 50 mm Pentax Macro lens.  Just from a few test photos in my office and yard, I can say witut doubt that this lens BLOWS AWAY anything else I own for close-up shots (even with the FLASH at close quarters!).  If you squeeze the trigger while the camera and le in focus, you have a "keeper," every single time.  And, yes, most of the time you really WANT to focus manually, though the auto-focus does a great job if you are willing to let it occasionally "rack" all the way back and forth.  A lens like THIS is what I've been craving for my wildflower photos, as well as insects and other subjects that need REAL ONE TO ONE treatment.  The only thing is that, because it zeroes in so closely, (unless you have steady hands,) you usually want the stabilization of a monopod or tripod for your best shot.BE GLAD you aren't paying the extra price of Image Stabilization IN EVERY LENS.  That is what I call the Pentax Advantage (what do you think of Nikon and Canon, NOT putting the stabilization in the camera body, but making you pay for that decision by THEM CHARGING YOU WITH $50 extra FOR EVERY LENS?)!  Plus those cameras feel like they are ALL PLASTIC, and Pentax has the heft of professional-grade equipment, with a durable machined-metal shell.  This Pentax K20 camera is quality equipment, as well as the Tamron lens - and they are a great combo.  I urge you to BUY THIS LENS!  I don't think you'll regret the decision to buy, and Amazon is a trusted source, not a flea market.  I don't trust "vendors" who offer stuff that is just hitting the market, and ask for less than wholesale:  I smell a scam!  Do what you want; I trust Amazon.	1
I bought this video camera about 2 years ago because I thought it was top-of-the-line back then, at a reasonable price. The picture quality was good, and I loved the size, but I recently sold it on eBay and bought a Canon HF-200 for the following reasons: 1) I absolutely hated the Panasonic's joystick toggle on the inside panel...not ergonomic at all, confusing to use, I wanted the touch controls on the screen itself, 2) on more than one occassion my wife and I both thought we were recording when, in fact, we were not.  The Panasonic's screen info was always confusing, and we missed several very important moments due to the confusion. The main problem is that when you turn the camera on the screen says "Recording to card".  It's stupid because there is nothing else besides the card it can record to, and my wife often thought it mean it was literally recording, i.e., it was shooting video, when in fact it was not.  You still had to press the Record button.So be warned there are some serious usability issues with this camera: the joystick on the inside panel, and the info screen.  Also, the surround-sound is totally useless for everyday recording of family events.  When we played video back on our home theather it produced a huge, unnecessary echo effect.So do your research and compare notes.  Btw, the Canon has a 15x zoom, that is the other nice thing.  And the HF-200 is a good price!  I sold my HDC-SD9 for $305 on eBay.	0

Picture quality is excellentControls and joystick are hard to useConnection to TV is riduculous, you have to remove the battery and use power adapter in order to connect through HDMI, ..........WTF?Forget about editing videos on this camera, this software and most out there are useless for AVCHD2 stars for picture quality	0
I truly love this lens its just amazing.  The image quality produced is simply incredible although the build quality isn't the best is sure can withstand some abuse.  The front lens element is a couple inches inside the barrel of the lens which i find great because it protects the lens from potential damage and there are practically never any flares so you don't need  the included hood making the lens more compact. The weight of the lens is just right not to heavy to make it a burden to carry around but not too light as for it to feel that it was made cheaply.	1
This camera is not really HD.  It doesn't even have enough pixels for 1920x1080 resolution, so how can they claim that it's HD?  SD9 has gross pixel count 560000.00 pixels x 3.  Which is about 1.5 megapixels.  1920x1080 is over 2MP.The SD9 is very difficult to hold still, so all of your videos will be very jerky.  It also compresses the video a lot when there is too much motion, so you will notice the recorded resolution is worse than SD video (most of the time).Terrible low-light performance.  Noise is clearly visible in dark and light portions, in full sunlight and relative darkness.TERRIBLE dynamic range.  If you have a scene with shadows and highlights, neither of them will look good.There is way too much noise even for a sensor so small, 1/6".If you like to take photos, you will not like this camcorder.The photos are so incredibly blocky that you will wish you had taken them with a cellphone.24p mode is uselesss because it forces Cinema Colors, which is good on other camcorders, but terrible on this one.  There is no way to choose 24p without it also setting 'Cinema Color' which is only made to look good on Panasonic tvs.  If you choose 24p, it will turn on cinema color and you can't turn it off without turning off 24p.The lens also has very narrow angle.  You need toThe footage looks good on the small lcd screen, but when viewed on a computer, it lacks saturation and resolution.  There are no options for saturation on the camcorder itself.	0

I own a Panasonic digital camera which I enjoy very much. it takes great pictures and it beats Nikon, Sony and Canon in many aspects. Despite my satisfaction with the camera, I did not think of Panasonic when I was on the market for a high defiction camcorder. So I came across the SD9 and was surprised by the low price as by reading the specifications: 3CCD, full HD at 1080p, 24p film mode, it appears to be a very high quality camcorder. But after two weeks of use, I am completely disappointed. The video quality is OK when in very bright condition(day time outdoor). Other than that, video is very noisy with color way off. In my opinion, it can not even compare to a $300 regular camcorder.  I wanted to give it one star but considering that it is very compact, light and is generally easy to handle, I give it two stars.	0
I thought I was buying the latest Tamron 90mm Macro with VC (Vibration Compensation) but I was looking for a bargain and found the lowest price.  This lens is about $200 less than the newer VC model so be careful what you are buying.I tested the handheld capability of the lens to see if the common butterfly or flower shot would work well enough without the tripod.  I would say that one in ten shots were acceptably sharp.  Not great if you are only given a very limited opportunity.  I am a firm believer in using a tripod and own three of them.  Sometimes though, a tripod is not appropriate when you are chasing down some critter to take it's portrait!  LOL  Nonetheless, this is a great lens that will serve it's purpose and save the $200.	1
The silver edge on the bottom includes a flip-down portion in the middle to access sound, usb, etc.  Great.  Problem is that the color of that portion (about 3" long in the center) is very different from the rest of that silver strip, making it very unattractive.  Most of the stip is a dark steel color, while the flip color is light grey.  You can't tell this from the picture on Amazon or from the pictures on the manufacturer's web site.  I think the manufacturer intentionally makes the images look diferent from the actual case, so it's not really Amazon or TigerDirect's fault. I can't comment as to function because I sent it back.	0

I bought this camera after reading many reviews commenting about how bad the menu system is and how grainy the night pictures are.  Now i have an old Sony Cybershot 3.2 mp... So I thought that the reviews were perhaps overly critical and it could only be a vast improvement on my 8 year old camera.  I bought one and have used it for a month and am now looking to sell it second hand.  The menu system is frustrating in the least.  Switching between video and still mode takes 4 button clicks (Sony = 1 click).  Changing the mp's takes at least 8 button clicks (Sony = 3 clicks).  The night pictures in my 8 year old Sony are better.  The battery life is disappointing.  The design, although very sexy is not very functional.  All the negative reviews i had read were very appropriate.	0
I picked up the Tamron 90mm f/2.8 1:1 macro lens while the Tamron $50 rebate is still in effect (good through the end of year). I am pretty much limited to lenses that are $500 or less, and have a Nikon D5000, so I was interested in a lens with a focusing motor. This lens, after rebate, was just over $400. One of the things that I wanted was to use the lens for indoor photos of school plays and the like, so I wanted it to be as bright as possible. I don't currently have a macro lens, so that was a plus -- although I am not really into macro photography, and have theKenko DG Auto Extension Tube Set for the Nikon AF Mount.that have met what little need I have for such things so far.I am very favorably impressed with many aspects of this lens. It is sharper and brighter than theNikon 85mm f/3.5G AF-S DX ED VR Micro Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameraswhich was also in my price-range. It is just about as sharp as a lens can possibly be. Its color rendition, contrast, and bokeh are very pleasing. The motor is not silent, but close enough for me. The speed of focus is adequate for my purposes -- I don't do sports shooting and the like. Truth to tell, I don't have the chops for anything that won't sit still for me to figure out what I need to do.Two aspects of the lens were disappointing, however. First, there is a lot more chromatic aberration (CA) than I was expecting, especially given SlrGear's assessment of CA on this lens. I use the auto-lateral CA removal with Capture NX2 and I never see any CA after that on any other lens I own -- even those that are known for their tendencies in this direction (my other lenses include the Tokina 12-24 f/4 DX II and theNikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). This lens, however, showed very obvious CA, especially wide open, even after removing lateral CA. The good news is that I am able to fully remove the CA using Capture NX2's axial CA removal slider. I just wasn't expecting to have to.Second, the clearance distance between the subject and the lens at 1:1 is stunningly short. Because the lens is recessed into its housing, at 1:1 the front of the lens housing is not much more than one inch from the focal point. I was expecting much better working distances from a 90mm lens. Macro isn't that important to me, so this isn't that big a deal. But, if I were actually caught up in macro (which I imagine the target market is) this lens would make me uncomfortable for that use. And it would not be possible to add one of the Kenko extenders to increase the magnification of this lens.Overall, I am quite happy so far with this lens. It is a very good bargain. But it is not an unalloyed blessing.	1
the camera looks nice, has a full size seperate SD card and a large viewing screen, and uses AA batteries..all these are pros.the cons are, the video is very inferior compared to the flip (we bought both the rca ez210, ez205 AND FLIP ULTRA). the ez210 has slightly better video than it's smaller version the ez205...but still is fairly blurry, unable to see deatails the flip has no problem with. e.g. i video-ed a phone book ad and the flip was easily read but both rca's you could not read the printing...colors on the rca are washed out compared to the flip, and the rca does not nearly as well in low light and gets washed out in brighter colors, especially if there is any difference in gradients...my wife's face was washed out when the light from the outside window was on her, not so with the flip.the rca ez210's video is only slightly better than the ez205. the rca takes a totally different jack connection when hooking to the tv than does the flip, the access to the USB connector on the rca is totally bizzare...you have to remove the carrying handle then push a button and then slide up an arm, which is very very short and not easliy connected to the computer. in doing so it is very easy to loose track of where the carrying handle was put...plus a few times doing this, i think the carrying handle would suffer a break at the plastic ends.i got the rca for 111 at amazon, but another 20 off using buy later. i got the 1G flip for 50 at dellhome on a special. i feel the flip was far better in a deal and you could buy two of them for what i paid for the rcaez210. i sent the ez205 back as it's video was horrible. i am close to sending the rca ez210 back, but only the bottom line of 91dollars keeps me from doing that...plus the snapshot feature, the sd card and large screen,,,i just can not rate this anymore than 2 stars, and then only because i got a decent price, more money---it is just NOT worth more.	0

I bought this for a PC I have hooked up to my big screen TV.  It worked well for a few weeks, then the USB transmitter only communicated intermittently with the keyboard.  Finally, after a few months, it stopped working altogether.  I have tried resetting it and changing out batteries but to no avail.	0
I heard many good things about this lens before I made up my mind to get it, and I'm glad I did. Very nice, sharp, contrasty and good colors. It's definately worth the price.Update: 2012 This is my most used lens and I still love it. I fell into a brook with this lens on my camera and it still works! It look a while to work the sand out but it's fine and quality has not suffered! This is a well built lens, worth every penny.	1
At first I loved this item. I kept in in my wallet. It started to crumble, then stopped working alltogether.I purchased one for my wife and her's still works but I think she used it twice.Great product in theory but could not stand up to what they advertized. Great price.	0

This is listed as an 8gb drive. Normally that would be 7.45 real-world gigs. But this is actually 7.5gb in drive numbers, or only 7gb in real-world numbers. In other words, the size is overstated by a full 13%. This disparity between advertised and actual size is even acknowledged in the drive identifier string, which reports as: "7.5 GB Kingmax USB2.0 FlashDrive"That makes this drive too small for the 8g USB stick-targeted OS installers.	0
Awesome macro and portrait lens. Great alternative to Nikon 105mm. I mainly use this for shooting flower's insects and bugs and portraits. I'm very pleased with this lens and it suits my needs. Although it's not that great built vs the nikon 105mm. It still gives you an outstanding result.	1
I had previously bought the 4GB version of this drive and it had worked well for over a year, even with being on a keychain or in my pocket. One of them even had the ring end break off and I had to glue it together but it is still working... I thought to get a larger one but this one has died and can not be recognized on any system, laptop or desktop that I have tried it on and this after only a few months!! Don't even bother with the "Lifetime warranty"... once they have your money they are gone. Kingmax used to be pretty reliable but they have dropped off my list of good vendors for high capacity drives.	0

The idea was amazing. It's so small, fits anywhere. But when using it I've noticed it gets very hot. After few weeks it just stopped working. Couldn't do anything. Probably fried itself.	0
This lens is incredibly sharp as all good lenses should be. It is a little slow to focus, but I haven't used a macro lens that isn't. The secret is to use the focus limiter switch.	1
Not sure if it's the hardware or my specific use scenario, but I'm not at all satisfied with the sound quality of this little guy. Popping and hissing like crazy.	0

I have a large laptop cooling stand by Xbrand but it does not have the USB hubs, so I thought this model would be an upgrade.I'm trying to keep the clutter down on the table.First of all, it needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet. The cord is so short that I needed to use an extension cord from the wall outlet to my laptop on the breakfast room table.There is a latch operated storage space on the underside of the cooling station for the USB wire connector etc. The tit on the latch is so small, the plastic so glossy and smooth and the latch is so close to the fan cover that you cannot grasp it to push it back to open the storage area.. I had to use a screwdriver, and wire pliers to get the thing open ! Design flaw ?????There is a specific sequence for everything to be plugged in. They have included the shortest USB cord I have ever seen in my life to go from the USB port on the side of my 17.5 inch Toshiba laptop to the port on the back of the cooling stand. It is stretched so tight I think it might damage my laptop's USB port if my laptop were to be bumped or moved out of position. Ridiculous !!! If I move my laptop backward on the stand it makes the angle uncomfortable and my wrists hit the front edge of the cooling stand.The height adjustment is not very significant so if you are looking for a cooling stand with a high angle, this is not for you.The last straw was when I got everything plugged in and turned it on....THE FAN DIDN'T WORK......It would cycle on then off then back on....As if there was a wiring short. I checked all connections and then e mailed Amazon.com to return this product. No point in taking a chance on another one. I'll just hook up a 4 port USB hub and stick with the cooling station I have (& learn to love the cluttered look). It gets the job done just fine and costs half of what this sells for.Now for the hassle of re packaging everything....gr-r-r-r-r-r	0
I would not hesitate to buy another non-Pentax, Pentax-compatible lens.  This lens captures amazing portraits; and once I got used to using a prime lens, I tended to leave it on the camera.	1
The idea behind these things is cool. You can buy one set of filters, and use them on all of your lenses. But in in practice, these have been a pain to use. The problem is they are difficult to take off of either your camera or your lens. If you try to use this with a circular polarizer, you will have to tighten it down quite a bit so that when you turn the polarizer it doesn't unscrew. But when you try to take if off, you will have a difficult time doing so, and if you try when it's cold, good luck with that.	0

Very flimsy step up ring. Gets stuck on the lens difficult to change filters. Sometimes one is afraid if it will break the lens while removing.	0
I usually only buy Pentax lenses.  This was my first journey into going with Tamron and I could not be happier!  This is a quality lens and you can feel it's solid.  It has nice front and back covers and a high quality case.  As far as how it works--well I have no complaints!  It focuses right up and I love playing with it not only for macro but also for just regular shots of various subjects.  I will definitely buy from Tamron again!	1
The item was listed as working with a Macbook. I didn't know that Macbooks have two different connectors depending on the exact model you have. I had to send this one back and eat the shipping in both directions. I tried to order another one from a different vendor and it never arrived after waiting another 3 weeks. I finally broke down and drove 50 miles to Greensboro, NC to the closest Apple Store. I was in and out the door in less than 5 minutes and bought an adapter for $19.00. It cost more but I had what I needed. I went home and had my Macbook hooked up to my 32" LCD TV in less than 5 minutes. A lot easier to do graphic design work on, and with an audio cable I can now watch Netflix on my TV without having to buy a Ruku.	0

Purchased this model due to high ratings and good pricing.  We are indeed on the fringe of TV reception in our rural location and haven't had much success with indoor antennas.  This one was no better than the other makes and models we've tried.  Product may be OK for locations with better signal, but we'll never know.  Bottom line - if you have bad reception with other antennas, you may very well have bad reception with this antenna, too.	0
Like many folks, I read the near legendary level ratings on this lens and finally took the leap as I would be able to compare it side by side with a Nikon 105 2.8. I bought the lens from KEH.com for just 329.00, second hand but in like new condition. This is the DI model which is supposed to be optimized for digital. Some people who have the older version claim there is little or no difference between them.Sharpness:The Tamron 90 will give you incredible sharpness. I believe it's my sharpest lens easily a match for my 1700 dollar 70-200 VR at 90mm. It's sharper than the Nikon 105 2.8Color:Simply faultless. Again, this lens is astounding in color rendition. Skin tones are fantastic.Bokeh:Again, this lens rivals my more expensive zoom, though I slightly prefer the bokeh on the 70-200. The Tamron is far superior to the Nikon 105 Micro for out of focus rendering.Handling:The lens hood is a bit awkward to get on and off. The auto/manual mode is a push-pull slide color. It works, but it's easy to slip it into either mode by accident. The focus limit switch is a dial, which is odd. Manual focus is excellent on this lens. The lens is mostly plastic and doesn't feel as solid as the Nikon 105, but I hear no stories of the Tamron falling apart either.Overall:The Tamron beats Nikon's entry in every area, except build. The Tamron is sharper and has better bokeh. As a portrait lens it does a very good job, though ultimate sharpness is not always desired in model work or even candids. A lot depend on your style. There are certainly lenses like the Nikon 85mm 1.4 which will probably be more flattering to a face. For macro work the Tamron makes no excuses. It focuses down 1:1 nicely and my macro shots have been impressive from the start. Keep in mind that the Tamron 90 is only a 2.8 when shooting objects around 10 feet or further away. Otherwise expect apertures in the 3+ range. This is probably the best macro lens available in the 90-150mm range. I've yet to see any portrait shots from the new Nikon 105mm VR than are it's equal.

Like many folks, I read the near legendary level ratings on this lens and finally took the leap as I would be able to compare it side by side with a Nikon 105 2.8. I bought the lens from KEH.com for just 329.00, second hand but in like new condition. This is the DI model which is supposed to be optimized for digital. Some people who have the older version claim there is little or no difference between them.Sharpness:The Tamron 90 will give you incredible sharpness. I believe it's my sharpest lens easily a match for my 1700 dollar 70-200 VR at 90mm. It's sharper than the Nikon 105 2.8Color:Simply faultless. Again, this lens is astounding in color rendition. Skin tones are fantastic.Bokeh:Again, this lens rivals my more expensive zoom, though I slightly prefer the bokeh on the 70-200. The Tamron is far superior to the Nikon 105 Micro for out of focus rendering.Handling:The lens hood is a bit awkward to get on and off. The auto/manual mode is a push-pull slide color. It works, but it's easy to slip it into either mode by accident. The focus limit switch is a dial, which is odd. Manual focus is excellent on this lens. The lens is mostly plastic and doesn't feel as solid as the Nikon 105, but I hear no stories of the Tamron falling apart either.Overall:The Tamron beats Nikon's entry in every area, except build. The Tamron is sharper and has better bokeh. As a portrait lens it does a very good job, though ultimate sharpness is not always desired in model work or even candids. A lot depend on your style. There are certainly lenses like the Nikon 85mm 1.4 which will probably be more flattering to a face. For macro work the Tamron makes no excuses. It focuses down 1:1 nicely and my macro shots have been impressive from the start. Keep in mind that the Tamron 90 is only a 2.8 when shooting objects around 10 feet or further away. Otherwise expect apertures in the 3+ range. This is probably the best macro lens available in the 90-150mm range. I've yet to see any portrait shots from the new Nikon 105mm VR than are it's equal. I give this lens my highest rating.Capt RB	1
I live 8 or 9 miles from the bulk of the transmitter towers here in Houston. Antennaweb.org said I wouldn't need a very elaborate antenna, so I ordered this to go along with an HDHomerun digital network tuner that lets you watch and record tv from computers on the network using Windows Media Center built into Windows 7 and Vista.  Don't know how sensitive the HDHomerun tuner is, so that may have some effect on the signal strength readings I'm getting. Also, there are lots of trees around and I have no idea what effect they have. I only get a usable signal on about half of the available channels and a good quality signal on just a few. I tried running it indoors, then out, then in the attic. It worked a little better outside, but none of these variations made a significant difference. I did manage to get a strong signal on the local affiliate that carried the Lions/Patriots game on Thanksgiving and picture was beautiful. I guess I'll have to go for an outdoor antenna and maybe an amp.	0
Wow, all i have to say is Wow!!!!!.  I have never, ever, ever gotten the results that I get with this lens with any of my &#34;normal&#34; lenses.  I had a friend that got this lens and let me use it.  I went twice to a tropical garden here in town where they have a butterfly building, what great images I am getting.  I am a professional photographer but I am getting also a Fine Arts degree in photography.  I used this lens for a couple of my assignments.  What an incredible lens.	1
This antenna is not a drastic improvement in style or space savings over more traditional rabbit ear designs. I have tried at leas 5 antennas and this one performed second to last. I started off with dollar store rabbit ears, they worked surprisingly awesome, but I had no place to put them and they were falling apart (I liked that antenna so much I resoldered it and am using it in a different room with an older TV). Next I got theTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception, this antenna worked even better than the rabbit ears, but the antenna on the main TV on my house was not working to well so I swapped figuring the variable performance had more to do with the location of the antenna and less the antenna itself, I was wrong, the higher end radio shack amplified antenna was the worst.That brings me to this antenna, I bought it in combination with theTerk FDTV1A Flat Digital Omni Directional Amplified Indoor Antenna-Blackusing a splitter/combiner. I tried every combination imaginable, the FDTV2A antenna amplified, the phillips amplified, the combined signal amplified, or totally unamplified, as well as each antenna individually amplified and unamplified. I got the worst signal using this antenna by itself amplified or not. This antenna has poor performance, and it isn't  as good as theTerk FDTV1A Flat Digital Omni Directional Amplified Indoor Antenna-Black, for a similar price. If you want excellent performance and have the space, go with theTerk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception.  If you don't have space perhaps the leaf is worth a try, and if cost is a factor go to your dollar store and pick up a basic set of rabbit ears. For reference I live in a suburb of denver around 15 miles from the broadcast towers.	0

do not buy you have to buy adapter---does not fit any of my lenses.-as advertised--does not fit my cameras Nikon d200 and 7000	0
I bought this lens based upon Amazon reviews, and I was not disappointed; it has exceeded my expectations in studio photography applications.  The lens body is plastic and the AF/MF selection on the lens takes a little getting used to, but these characteristics are not of practical consequence in my applications.  I use manual focus exclusively with this lens.The low f/2.8 provides a narrow depth of field and great bokeh with reduced light, while with high strobe levels, higher depth of field can be obtained in macro shots.  I've had great results in jewelry and portraiture photography with this lens, a great deal especially with the $50 rebate until 12/31.	1
This is not a lens as it is listed since it screws on the end of a lens it is a filter I also question if it even has any fisheye effect.  I have two Nikon cameras with several lenses and I could only find two lens it would fit using all the adapters that came with it.  I tried it on both and got absolutely no fisheye effect, zero, zilch!!!  All it did was make things look a little further away and out of focus.  The Autofocus could focus on the subject and I could not get it to focus on manual either.  Save your money and time.	0

This lens screws onto the end of an existing lens and only supports a few lens sizes.  Make sure you have a lens that is compatible in the first place.The actual useable, non-blurred area of this lens is extremely small.  You may have a very large field of vision, but at least 30-40% of the viewable area is so blurry as to be unuseable.  This is more like a novelty-effect-type lens than a wide angle or fisheye.On a 50mm Nikon 1.8 lens, the increased angle is marginal - the pictures other reviewers have posted of the effects of this lens are misrepresented.  They've cropped the huge amount of out-of-focus field.  My advice is save your money.  This lens is largely useless, low quality and annoyingly blurry.  As others have said, "It's not a fisheye" - and yet it's being identified as a "fisheye".  Other reviewers have also said, "It's not a lens, it's an adapter" yet this product is being marketed as a "lens."  This entire product is grossly misrepresented and needs to be pulled.  It's not worth even a fraction of what they're asking.  Junk.  Caveat Emptor!	0
Right out of the box I was impressed. Many reviews I had read said it felt lightweight or had a plastic feel compared to the Nikkor 105mm.  I don't know about that but it feels great to me. While this may not be as heavy as the Nikkor it felt right and looked good straight away. I have always used Nikon lenses (other than a Sigma 10-20mm I have, another great lens) so I do think twice about anything other than Nikkors. I am not disappointed with this Tamron. It is pin sharp, feels nice in the hand on the camera (D300) and the manual focus slide control works smoothly. For macro you do need manual focus. A review I read somewhere said it was slow to focus and sounded noisy. Can't agree. Maybe it is not as fast as the Nikkor (I have not tested the Nikkor) but this lens focuses fast enough at longer ranges. No different to other lenses I use in term of speed in focusing, that I can notice. And I don't find it noisy. And what a deal with $90 off thru April. I am critical about my lenses and would not have a poor quality lens in my bag. Makes a nice portrait lens. Don't hesitate - get it now.	1
Right after the warranty expired it quit working. Sometimes I get one speaker working, other times neither works.  I bang on it and sometimes that makes the speakers work again.  Sometimes I have to toggle the switch on and off several times to get it to work. When it was new the sound was loud and clear on my Bose speakers.  Over time the sound has become weak and inconsistent. I tested the speakers on another amp and they work great. This product is bad bad bad.	0

plugged it in sounded great, for about 45 minutes, everything went dead, now we are sending it back, spend the money and get a nicer one	0
I spent a month or two researching macro lenses before finally settling with the tamron 90mm, and I really couldn't be happier with my decision. I was also considering the sigma 105mm and the canon 60mm, but ultimately I decided to go with this one because I wanted a lens that could double as a portrait lens and work as a macro where I could have some distance from my subject. I got it to shoot flowers and bugs primarily, and since I am terrified of (and deathly allergic to) the latter, I opted for the 90mm. I absolutely love this lens. I  find that I am favoring it over my canon 28-105mm as a general use lens. Cost was definitely a deciding factor, and as a hobby for an amateur photographer like myself, this lens is ideal both financially and artistically.	1
I bought this amp about a year ago for occasional use as a workplace music system. It sounded pretty good for most of its short life, but after some time the treble control ceased to work. Then it developed a shrieking clipped-audio sound that happens during loud parts of the music, when turned up anywhere below a very low volume.I can tell that one or more of its key internal components has failed, which is not too surprising given its low sticker price. I only wish companies like this would keep the same nice barebones design, but use less junky components. The cost would only rise by a few dollars, but it would become a lifetime product like amplifiers are supposed to be, instead of a disposable 1-year product (I still have old Yamaha receivers from the 1980s that work perfectly, for example).Looking at the other reviews of this and the larger 75 watt model from Pylepro, I can see this is a common occurrence. When you combine this with their lack of warranty support, I can safely put this company on my list of manufacturers never to buy from again. No big loss. Just be warned when buying that it's not a durable product.	0

This amplifier has a few good things going for it:- it is really really cheap if you do not need a full function receiver- it is smallWhen I first bought this in 2010 I thought it was ok.  I hooked it to my iMac and played music through some bookshelf speakers I had when I work.  I didn't need much:  I control the volume on the computer and I didn't particularly need any tone controls and I would say it met those needs, though not without some trouble.  When I first hooked it up, one of the channels didn't seem to work.  I swapped speaker wire, speakers, line inputs and I determined it was none of those, it was the amplifier.  I fiddled with the volume control and found that at maximum gain I could hear music through the missing channel.  More fiddling and the channel started working.  Touch the volume:  stopped working.  Mess with it again:  maybe starts working.  You probably get the idea.  I found that the volume control made a very scratchy/crackling sound through the speakers so you would not want to fool with it much anyway.I typically played it at pretty low volume so I didn't notice any sound quality issues, but when I turned it up a little it was tiring to listen to.  Notice the 40W x 2 is a maximum rating, it is actually 2x8W 1% THD (and typically they rate that at 0.08% THD).  Kind of feeble.I guess it did its business well enough for the last 3 years, at least in my particular use case.  Recently it started dropping out one of the channels even when I didn't touch it, so I decided to move on.I replaced it withOnkyo TX-8255 Stereo Receiverwhich is a stereo receiver.  Yes, it costs 5x as much but the build quality but it sounds great at ALL volume levels.  This would have been a better buy for me.	0
I already have 2-Cannon, 1-Sigma, and 2-Tamron lenses. All great lenses on my pair of Canon 60D bodies. Packaging was great as per normal from Amazon and the box appears to be a real Tamron box and the lens appears new with all the proper packaging.  On preliminary testing this lens seems like all my others, a great lens. Further testing (as I do with all my lenses) will hopefully prove this to be the case.  My concern is this is the first lens bought from (or through) Amazon that is a &#34;grey market&#34; lens. I was not aware of this at the time I purchased it (Sold by Another Deal Site). As long as the lens proves out and does not have any defects I will be happy with the purchase since it appears Tamron will not provide any warranty for this lens.  I will provide an update should a problem occur.	1
I didn't buy it, but from the review I read of the electrolytic power capacitor leaking after less than 14 months usage, I have no intention of buying it.For less (around 20 bucks), I could buy a 40 watt stereo from Goodwill from the 80's and 90's with discrete components so I can fix it when it breaks.	0

First purchase from Amazon warehouse (assume previous return). Great savings but poor product. received in short time. Plug in no power lights, no output. Waiting on a second Amazon Warehouse order anyday. Check my reviews to see how it turned out. This is more of a Amazon Warehouse rating than the Pyle Home PCA@ Amp.	0
This is a very nice, high quality lens.  But what else would you expect from Tamron?  I would buy this again, and recommend it highly.	1
absolute junk started smoking after 30 secs of being on and got burning hot  now i need to return and find a better one	0

I feel like I was mislead by the power rating. I didn't expect a full 40 watts per channel. Honestly, I was hoping for 20, what I got was probably about 4.Yes, it can get loud. But it gets too much distortion. I typically listen to music at low volumes, and even then it doesn't deliver clean enough power for me.I think Pyle could save everyone a whole lot of grief and headaches if they would just rate this amp as 20watt (10 watts per channel). Then I'd know to move up to one of their bigger amps(they are only a few dollars more). I feel like Pyle deliberately wasted my time and money by mislabeling their product.I'm going to try going with an Audiosource Amp-50 instead.	0
This is a superb lens, there is not much to add, its very sharp, very well built and at a very affordable price. Great for macros, great for portraits great for everyday use. It's the best lens I have ever owned in terms of image quality, highly recommended.	1
My experience was that from the start the left Audio in was to big to fit a standard cable. Then the spring on the right wire in connector broke loose. I haven't used the thing to have that much go wrong.	0

1) Warranty info requires that YOU PAY SHIPPING COST BACK AND INCLUDE ANOTHER $20 IN CARTON FOR SHIPPING BACK TO YOU.  This makes twice original price before you even get it back.  AND you have to make a toll call to get permission to send it back and MUST have full paperwork also.2. As of 2.29.12 this is out of their product line.	0
I've never owned a Tamron lens, heard all the talk about build quality, bad samples, poor focusing, etc. so was admittedly hesitant to spend the money even if it was less expensive. Being in the market for a Macro lens I researched all the usual suspects for use on a Nikon D7000 and D700. The Nikon 105, Sigma 105 and the Tokina 100. Actually managed to round up these three in a local shop and tried them side by side, with the Nikon coming out ahead in my opinion. (This Tamron wasn't available at the shop) That evening as I was thinking about it and reading the glowing reviews for the Tamron optics I ran across one in "Like New" used condition at the big Georgia lens seller for &#8804; $250 so I pulled the trigger.Two days later it was on my camera and I put it through the paces. Build quality is just fine it's no "pro" lens and never will be but for typical prosumer use it's just fine. Focus speed is also just fine, again it's no Pro lens and doesn't pretend to be, but it works perfectly in 95% of the situations I put it in. ( It hunts in low indoor light like most macros, the Nikon being better at this, but for the most part if in "Macro" you'll be using manual focus anyway) Optically it's the equal of the Nikon in sharpness and contrast but the Nikon beats it badly in color fringing. ( You'll have to clean it up in post a bit). I dislike the push/pull auto to manual focus system on the Tamron but it may be perfect for someone else. I don't miss the VR (vibration control) one bit although I imagine many might.The best way I can describe this is like the Nikon 85 f1.4 vs the 85 f1.8. The 85 f1.8 is 95% of the 85 f1.4 at a third the price. Is the 1.4 better? You bet it is for most. Does the 1.8 do what you need it to do the great majority of the time? Yup it does and at far lower cost. It was obvious that the Tamron lenses didn't hold their value on the used market, but the Nikon loses value as well and this lens cost me about the depreciation value between a new vs used Nikon 105.. all I have to do now is figure out what lens I want to spend the near $700 I have left over.	1
This thing smoked so much when we plugged in in that we were afraid that it was about to catch fire, I would not have gone to bed at night with this thing plugged in.	0

When I received this item, there was a loose screw inside that was rattling around.  I had to take the unit apart to re-attach the screw, which was supposed to be holding the power supply in place.  That by its self was not a big deal.  Then the amplifier worked fine for about 2 weeks, then it doesn't work anymore.  Overall poor quality and I am very disappointed, an amplifier should certainly work for longer than 2 weeks before it burns out.  I thought Pyle was a good quality American brand.  This item has a big &#34;Made in China&#34; sticker on the bottom of it, it is just cheap Chinese junk with the Pyle brand name on it.  Pyle should be ashamed of themselves for selling such garbage.  I guess I will now see if I can return this piece of junk for a refund.	0
It work preatty fine in my Nikon D5100, the focus is a little slow but it is not a big problem	1
I bought two Pyle Stereo Mini Power Amplifier systems in the same week. The first one worked fine for a week than died. the second one was D.O.A. The speakers had a loud buzz. I had no source cables hooked up yet just speakers. I'm going to try a different model. I will be righting about the next amp experience	0

This amp has a misleading Label.  40W is the PEAK output.The real output is 8 Watts x 2 (.03% THD, which is very decent)The real output is 10 Watts x 2 (1%THD, which was acceptable in the 1960's)The FTC requires Audio Amplifiers use the Primary rating to be given as continuous (8 hours), all channels driven into rated load (in this case, 4 ohms)The small size is very nice if you only need a single input amp for a little more oomph on a TV (with audio out) or a portable device.	0
I have these lens for over a year now and I am really impressed by the quality of the pictures I get with it.The lens are sharp, and have great bokeh for out of focus subjects. The AF speed is a bit slow when you are shooting Macro - but the same goes for the Nikkor 105 VR micro. For portrait shoots the AF speed is quite good, especially when you limit the AF switch to focus on subjects not in Macro mode. I see no reason to buy the Nikkor/Canon lens unless you have to due to camera constrains (like if you have the D40/60).These are great lens and you won't be sorry for getting them.I cannot say anything bad about them.	1
Was OE in Vostro 1520 Failed 10 mos into use. Owner reported no earlier prob but noted slow boot up on occasion. Failure was total and catastrophic with no ability to scavenge files although drive will initially spin up, not recognized on USB interface and note more than expected vibration on spin up. Dell replacing drive without question c/w orig W7 OS installed. Will re-partition after installation as have had more success scavenging files off 'dead' HDD when they have multiple partitions. Would be interesting to know what caused failure and if event viewer had warned of pending failure. Not my unit, but a lesson repeated B/U YOUR DATA!	0

This is a nice looking enclosure, not so compact. Its aluminium body handles heat very well....with a fanless operation. Very easy to fit the hard drive in and fasten it to the chasis. But of what use are these if the whole chasis is mounted on plascic ends. the rear cap which is a low quality plastic holds the whole heavy 3.5" drive. And the screws, mount into a plastic core. What this means is, dont screw it tight, it will remove the thread inside the plastic core and thats it...the screw keeps rotating.Here is the most important thing. I mounted a 2TB hard drive. And had to move/backup large amounts of data. The indicator LED glows in 3 colors. Blue, orange and red. Red means dead. Locked up, you have to switch off the hard drive before you can do anything with the dialog box/ progress indicator. 4 times dead red on Vista....I thought...Aaah well it may be the darn vista thing....so I moved to XP Pro.....same problem. Dead Red first attempt to copy. The data transfer is not reliable. The applications hangup and I used to blame the app. Like for Eg. iTunes updating the iPod hung, beyond exit or eject. Then I got a doubt....and the Hard drive has a red light!! What can I say.....I cant blame the hard drive because it is a high reliability Hitachi Deskstar, Then I ordered the Macally 3.5 inch enclosure.....no problem!! Transfers TBs of data flawlwssly. I have other external drives 3.5 and 2.5 never had such problems.....So, watchout.....This is a bad enclosure.:-)	0
Although the lens is listed as used, its appearance and functionality is like new. I cannot believe this product is listed as new except for any missing documents that usually accompany new Pentax lenses. But since I have been using Pentax lenses for over 30 years instructions are not necessary anyway.	1
I've owned this enclosure since February 2011.  It's worked all that time, but when I bought it I knew there was one major flaw in it: The enclosure is only made to handle drives with lower power requirements.  That means it won't take larger drives in the neighborhood of 2GB and up, even if the enclosure could could do it, possibly with a firmware update.The chainable FW400 ports were the reason I purchased this enclosure, and that people who had it said they were reliable.  And between February 2011 and July 2012, it was reliable with a 1TB hard drive.  For some, that's a good lifespan out of a drive enclosure.  Indeed, in that timespan, you can be sure that you probably should investigate NEW enclosures for newer, faster technologies--USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt in this case.But for an older drive and an older computer, this cheap FW400 enclosure only lasted about a year and a half.  The enclosure it replaced made by IcyDock was even less reliable over time.  And yet, I've got this enclosure sold by MassCool which is almost 5 years old, and it is still chugging along.  (I've read horror stories about some of their newer enclosures, but the one I have is solid!)Is this a good enclosure?  Today, I'd have to say no.  Not because of the lifespan--though that's part of it certainly.  It just has too many limitations with modern drives.  On top of that, if a year and change is the best you can get out of it...  No, there are better choices out there.	0
Although the lens is listed as used, its appearance and functionality is like new. I cannot believe this product is listed as new except for any missing documents that usually accompany new Pentax lenses. But since I have been using Pentax lenses for over 30 years instructions are not necessary anyway.	1
I bought it based on the cheap price and the reviews, thinking it is worth a shot, I might get lucky. Well, I didn't. When new, it worked great. Got up to 5 hrs of run time out of this. Around 3 months time, the battery just died. It wouldn't charge up. The only way to run the laptop with this battery now, is to constantly be plugged in. I am not sure if I should try another cheapo battery or spend the $100 or so on a battery from Dell.	0
This lens is a really great macro lens.  Very sharp photos, and it produces a beautiful bokeh.  I was surprised at how great a portrait lens it is too.  I was impressed and excited about the possibilities. HOWEVER, I was shipped a gray market lens which meant I was not eligible for Tamron's awesome warranty (and supporting the gray market isn't something I am interested in doing).  Be aware of this if you value your lens.  I am shipping mine back, and I am extremely disappointed this happened to me.  Amazon was great and totally understanding about the return.  Always check with the fulfillment store before ordering.  Nowhere on the description did it say I would be receiving a gray market lens, and the price was nearly the same as authorized dealers.  Caveat emptor...	1

I ordered 5 of these batteries.  The first order of 2 had the correct tabs at the top and they fit and worked perfectly.  The next 3 I ordered had a slightly different tab at the top on the right-hand side and it would not lock in on that side.  Ordered 3 of the Trent batteries for the D630 and they had the correct tab, they are a nice tight fit and locked in very easily.  Both batteries seem to hold a good charge but the Trent batteries are fitting and locking in better so far.	0
This is a good alternative to the Pentax 100mm F2.8 macro - image quality is a bit less rich - but not too much that you can tell the difference unless you really blow up your shots. Build quality is just ok - the Pentax is much more robust with an all metal construction and weather sealing. The auto-focus system works fast and great with the screw drive and it is nice that this lens has a limiter on it - macro lenses have a tendency to hunt and this one allows you to curb that behavior with the limiter. What I don't like is the fact that you have to not only shift the focus ring to switch to manual - but also have to change the parameter on the camera as well. The Pentax quick-shift system is much better. If you forget to toggle the switch on your camera - you may wreck havoc on your lens and the camera - just not a good implementation of a system that should be convenient. But for the price - good quality images and a nice lens. 4 Stars.	1
Well, this was a waste of money.Battery lasted about 2 weeks, during which time it ran very hot.Yesterday, the laptop reported that no battery was found.  Worse, the keyboard became intermittent, as did the mouse touchpad.  Several reboots did not resolve the issue.  Removed the battery completely, everything worked normally then.Shut everything down, swapped back to the old marginal battery...laptop's fine.Won't bother with another one.	0

I bought this battery on August 20th, 2010.  While a cheap replacement compared to the Dell factory batteries, it is not such a value when it only lasts 40mins at 4 months.1.  This is not a identical/same mold battery as many have mentioned or tried to imply that it came from the same factory.  There are seams and differences when you hold both in your hand, so they are not made from the same mold or even by the same factory.2.  I would see 2.5-3.5hours of life with the Dell extended/Hi capacity battery and about 1.5-2hours with the standard battery.  This battery was good for about 2hours when new and now after 4 months, it might last 45 minutes.3. I've noticed it gets much hotter than the factory dell batteries and that is a concern.  Every 6 months we see a news story where someones cell or computer replacement battery exploded/burned the user.  Just tonight I noticed the battery was actually much hotter than the cpu/vent area on the back of my Dell D620.	0
I really like this Tamron macro lens.  I'm used to stabilized Canon lenses and I'm not great with using this hand-held, but on a tripod it works great for me.  It can be a little loud if you are using autofocus (which I don't normally) and the push-pull thing you have to do to change between AF and MF sometimes takes some effort (but I don't' know why).  This is a specialty lens for me and isn't something I use that often so those things really are minor to me.  I don't use the included hood because the glass is deeply embedded in the lens, but you might have to use a LensPen or air blower to get out any dust because you will have a hard time reaching the glass it to rub it with a lens cloth.  I can't imagine it would get any thing more than dust on it though.I love the quality of the photos that I get using this lens and am really happy with the purchase. It's also really light (compared to the L lenses I normally carry) so adds very little weight to the camera bag.	1
Then all of the sudden my laptop would shut off, *poof*.  Would plug it in, battery says it has 94% remaining, unplug it and 30 seconds later would shut off again.Was working great since I got it back in July.  Problem just started a few days ago.Tried pulling the battery out and replacing it again, made sure the snaps were locked, etc.Problem is not with the battery compartment as I put my old battery in and the laptop is working fine.	0

It charges fast, but also discharges fast.  SSD, regular user, and the battery at first lasted about 3 hours.  Then it started discharging faster and faster.This battery is currently 3 months 2 weeks old.  About a week ago I could get about 50 minutes of run off the battery.Right now Windows7 reports that it is at 46% and charging.  Well, it's not charging.  I removed the battery, held power on the laptop, then reinserted the battery - no luck (none expected but I tried the basic advice that the internet had to offer).Despite it saying 46%, if I pull the AC cable, the laptop turns off.  If I press the built-in indicator on the battery, it shows no illuminated LEDs.  In other words, Windows sees a charge of 46% but it is actually zero and will not take a charge.Going to hope that a replacement matches the success stories on here instead of heaping me in with the already disgruntled users.  That's if they'll do an exchange - I don't see warranty info on here.UPDATE:The original seller (GOOD TIME) never responded so Amazon stepped in to offer a refund.  Although I appreciate that they stepped up like that, they charged me a restocking fee for a clearly defective product.  It was only a few dollars so I'm not concerned about it, especially considering their "just keep it instead of returning it" policy they gave me a few times for products I mis-ordered.For as bad as the product and the seller were, Amazon still rocks.  I'm back to using my OEM battery that lasts about 10 seconds after being unplugged - something this piece of junk couldn't accomplish when barely broken in.	0
Build quality is excellent. Slower focus but you can speed up focus by using the limit switch.Pretty sharp wide open and especially sharp @ f8. Definately worth the money especially when youconsider that the WR lens is almost $400 higher.Ordered this lens and had it shipped over night, arrived the next day. Packaging was more thanadequate. Thanks Amazon for the stellar job you do.I highly recommend this lens. It's the best $400 lens I've purchased.	1
Edit one week after my initial review:The battery failed completely. Not a gradual loss of capacity, but absolute, instantaneous failure. The laptop (BIOS and Windows) and the external gauge still show a full charge, but as soon as I disconnect other power sources, the PC shuts off. No low batt warning, just black screen. It's under warranty so Amazon's awesome customer service is giving me a full refund.Note that Amazon initially let me "buy" a "free" replacement, but that one was such terrible quality that I'm embarrassed to even have it near my computer. So now I'm returning both. With the E-serious getting cheap, is it still worth getting another D battery?---------------------------- Original Review ------------------------------------------------The battery is working great after about eight months. My original six-cell battery was down to 15 minutes. With this plus a new D-Bay secondary battery, I get through half of a malaria case without plugging in.Cons:The plastic shockingly is weak. I have a massive crack that looks like someone let loose with a .22 on the underside of the wrist rest. It hasn't affected structural integrity or burned my shorts/briefcase yet, but it worries me. Mechanical fit wasn't perfect even when new.The new lump takes some serious getting used to, for us longtime D620/630 users. With the new weakness right up front, I'm even more hesitant to let others handle my machine, even though I've gotten used to holding the main chassis from the side. There's definitely no benefit as a "wrist rest" unless you have deformed arms, but since it's a widescreen laptop there shouldn't be problems with fitting cases. It works ok in a D-Dock too.	0

I knew when I ordered this it was not a DELL battery, but the reviews were good so I figure I'd give it a chance.This battery is terrible.  After 6 weeks the battery only last 45minutes once unplugged.Worst product I've purchased through amazon.	0
I love using this. I've taken my photography in a new direction using this. The only drawback for me is that when you go wide open, autofocus goes nuts and just searches and searches for something to focus on. This is apparently normal for macro lenses. I'm learning to use manual focus. :)	1

Summary:  Great potential but too many serious flaws for such an expensive TV.Hardware:  Beautiful edge-to-edge glass.  It's not as heavy as the rugged shipping box implies.  Two normal people or one strong person can lift it onto a wall mount or stand.  While the edge of the glass has a powerful anti-glare coating, the viewing area itself doesn't!  Viewing in a bright room will be a problem.  Fans on the back of the TV are very quiet even in summer time.  A power supply behind the left side of the screen sometimes needs a tap to stop it from buzzing on bright images.Sound:  The speakers are awful but there's a digital link for your home theater.  None of the TV's sound controls or processing features work on the digital output - not even muting.  The internal speakers can be disabled to avoid accidental echos while using the home theater outputs.Menus and options:  Too many remote buttons, too many disabled menus, and non-standard names for features.  There are advanced image options to for your personal tastes and to keep your picture looking good for years.  The AGC switch does not work and this TV has a very annoying tendency to clip, dim, or brighten images.  The much flaunted "THX" mode produces horribly green-yellow images and it has no adjustment options.TV:  The picture quality is excellent and the tuner reception is up there with the best that I've seen.  There's no support for multiple station scans (needed with a rotating antenna) but the TV will automatically program itself for a virtual digital channel if you enter the real channel number.  Dithering flicker is noticeable on dark images but it is rarely distracting.Computer HDMI input:  The 1080p setting on a computer produces a perfect 1:1 pixel ratio with no signs of resampling.  Lack of a working AGC control causes the screen to darken when a white window is opened, brighten when a black window is opened, and throb on some animations.  There is very strong horizontal streaking.  Certain shades cause strong dither flickering.DNLA:  Zero.  The only local network connectivity is with certain Panasonic network cameras.SD playback:  False advertising!  Only JPEGs work.  Panasonic Customer Support states that the TV can play videos only from Sony and Panasonic video cameras that write directly to an SD card.  AVCHD and MPEG2 specification videos from other video cameras or a computer will not work.Amazon VOD:  An excellent selection of movies and a good user interface to find them.  Unfortunately there have been many periods where it hasn't worked.  When it does, Amazon provides several levels of bitrates to support all of America's antiquated Internet services.  Picture quality is quite good at the top bitrate and comparable to DVD at the second highest bitrate.  The bottom bitrate looks like an old VHS but with pixel jaggies.  There is no surround sound support.  Some movies, especially animation, may have jerky motion because the frame rate control menu is not available.  As of July 2010, Amazon VOD is not currently reliable.  The movie may go into a repeating "Loading..." loop or it may suddenly end with a "ding" and a grey screen.  Amazon VOD support said many Panasonic players are failing due to a problem that Panasonic must fix.YouTube:  Probably not a big deal, but playback doesn't respect aspect ratios.  Preview mode is 4:3 and fullscreen mode is 16:9 regardless of the video's actual dimensions.  The aspect ratio button on the remote control only works for TV channels.Pandora: A well polished GUI that's easy to navigate. The contrast remains at full so this music player costs you 510W of power unless you manually adjust it.  A screen saver is meant to protect against burn-in but it rarely gets a chance to activate if you're interacting with Pandora.Picasa:  Works nicely as a browser and slideshow viewer.  It takes quite a bit of fussing with the menus to get the picture looking good but it's stunning once it's done.  There's a small selection of maddening music loops that can optionally be played during the slideshow.Weather:  Works well but I usually just tune to a weather channel instead.Bloomberg:  The GUI is clumsy so I don't use it.Fox Sports:  Newer Panasonic TVs have it.  This model always says, "Coming Soon."	0
I was looking at two options, this and theTokina AF 100mm f/2.8as my macro lens.  Sigma has given me issue before andNikon 105mm f/2.8Gwas too expensive.  I tried both models before I got mine from two different friends.  The Tokina has a much better built quality or it was much heavier and a little bigger/wider lens body.  This Tamron is like a lighter plastic and narrower, looks very like my Nikon 55-200 kit size.  Half of the Tamron lens is like a sun flare cap.  The elements lies deep inside the lens.Image comparison.Sharpness of Tamron, Nikon and Tokina were similar.  I might say the Tokina was a littler softer, other time it was quite sharp.  Both did noticed the Tokina white balance is a little off.  I took the same shots on the Tokina and Nikon 18-200vr and the Tokina was much brighter. I even tried the Nikon 105mm macro VR from a friend, Tokina, Tamron and Nikon doesn't keep the 2.8 as the constant aperture, base on the focus it can go up to 4.5.  Since I didn't shot the same shots for all three, I can't really say if one is sharper then the other.  Tamron AF is very fast, and I think Tokina still used the camera body motor still.  I prefer lens motor.  This Tamron is not the DI 2 on theTamron AF 60mm f/2.0 SP DI II, with the quite motor, you can hear it.Well I got this at a good price, otherwise I might of gotten the Tokina.  You definitely need a tripod for macro.  There is a switch for limited and full AF.  Once you get close switch to limited.  The AF to manual is a push pull on the lens like the Tokina, for Nikon there is a switch.  I now have a macro lens, wide angle or a f2.8 70-200mm for sport is next on my list.	1
I just purchased a Samsung UN40B6000 LED TV to replace the 3-year-old LG TV hanging over my fireplace. The Samsung's 1080p display, even though edge-lit, is significantly better than the LG, but the LG had massively-superior sound ... the Samsung's sound sucks.Enter the Samsung soundbar that matches the TV. The soundbar itself outperforms the horrible sound of the TV, but I could not ... following all of the instructions multiple times ... get the wireless subwoofer to "link."That geing said, I understand that the soundbar is available ... for much less $$$ ... without the disfunctional subwoofer. That is my solution to the muddled sound of the TV.I moved that subwoofer all over the living room ... many retries ... never got it to work. In my opinion, it's a dud. I'll purchase the soundbar w/o the wireless subwoofer.Craig	0

Not real loud and I've had this for a couple of years now and it's not working so I just ordered an optical cable for it we'll see if that fixed it.  I'm not getting any sound at the moment.  It was good just not strong.  I have 5.1 in another room and it dominates this.  I'm samsung all the way but not proud of this sound bar...	0
Tamron AF 90mm f/2.8 Di SP aF/MF 1:1 Macro is a very good lens for macro pictures and also portrait shots. The lens is affordable and works well in all light conditions (flash in the dark), though I prefer early morning pictures. I like using the lens on manual focusing while everything else is set to automatic or macro setting on the Nikon D90.My only complaint, which is not really a complaint but a suggestion, is the noise of the lens in operation--it could be quieter. There also seems to be a lag time between pressing the button to take a picture and when the shutter activates, this could be faster response time. I recommend the Tamron AF 90mm f/2.8 for anyone who loves macro photography and requires an affordable lens.	1
We got this for use with a Samsung UN55B8500.  The subwoofer was NOT linked out of the box, though this was easy to fix once I knew the trick (turn off the TV or unplug the audio cable).  Sound quality of the 8500 is poor; this was definitely a substantial step up.  It's not audiophile-quality by any means, but it is decent for the price.  We also thought it was visually attractive.This speaker should have better integrated with the television, however.  In particular, since Samsung sells this to compensate for the poor built-in audio, they should have designed it to work seamlessly with the TV remote.  It instead requires yet another remote, a real nuisance.  We also found the volume to be a bit weak on some movies and other dynamic material.  It was adequate for general TV watching.  Finally, the fan was surprisingly loud at times, though most of the time it was either off or inaudible.Had that been the end of the story, I would have rated it three stars.  Fair sound, acceptable price, poor integration.Unfortunately, after a few days it stopped working -- right in the middle of a movie.  The lights remained on, but the sound stopped and it did not respond at all to the remote control.  I unplugged it from power, plugged it back in, and it worked for a couple more hours before it died again.  Rinse and repeat.  This doesn't appear to be a common problem based on others' reviews, but given the other issues and lacking any special Samsung integration, I'm returning it to find something with better performance.	0

Buying this to match my super thin LED Samsung TV was a no brainer.  I really wanted this to work.  It had the optical input, wireless soundbar and low profile design.For watching high-quality Bluray movies it performed well.. however it sounded really bad playing back music and regular TV.  There are no controls for the Subwoofer so you can't control it's volume.[...]	0
I just purchased a Pentax k20d with a Pentax 18-250mm lens - a very versatile lens that works well for day to day use. Since macro photography has always been a major interest for me and I'm wanting to get the biggest "bang for the buck" I liked the idea of a lens able to handle both portraits and macro work. After doing some research, the Tamron 90 mm f/2.8 with Macro had some impressive reviews esp for other camera brands. Since there was only one review here on Amazon I was a little hesitant to order. Since I wanted a 1:1 macro without spending a fortune, the only other serious contender was the Pentax 100mm Macro - however, Tamron is currently running a $[...] rebate combined with a 6 year warranty so I decided to give it a go.The first thing you will notice is the weight..it seems relatively well built but contains a bit more plastic than expected. The lens comes packed in a nice padded lens bag with drawstring [a nice little extra] and lens hood so no need to purchase either separately. It's very easy to install and the automatic function works seemlessly with the Pentax auto focus. Compared to the Pentax 18-250mm the Tamron was more inclined to "search" when focusing at least for the first few moments. I find it to be a little louder than the Pentax but not to the point of distraction.To switch from automatic to manual requires pushing or pulling a circle around the lens which seemed a bit odd to me - perhaps it is normal but I'm new to the Pentax line and have never used a Tamron lens so it took a few minutes to figure out (the instructions are all but useless - several large drawings in a plethora of languages).Now as to the actual image quality itself...of course being a macro you would expect this to a large extent but just to get a better feel I set up a few "test shots" using both the pentax and the tamron both set at same distance on a couple small objects - a coffee cup, a spider and the fine hairs on a cactus. while both resulted in fine detail and resolution - the tamron really struts its stuff when it comes to the background!As to what I did not like...again, perhaps this is an isolated experience but the first Tamron lens had to be returned due to inability to manually set aperature. The second worked but only in manual mode - would not function in aperature priority mode [Pentax K20D] and it is important to remember to change the settings in the Menu area of the camera body to allow aperature settings on the actual lens [it's the next to last setting on page 6 of 7 for those of you searching for it].Again, being new to Pentax and DSLR's in general perhaps this aperature set-up is more common than I realize [been using plain point and shoot after holding out for years with standard SLR's like the old Maxxum series from Minolata...I know - slow to change]. Even after changing the aperature on the lens it will not display as with all other modes. I was expecting tighter integration although it doesn't seem to impact the quality of the photo itself which is very nice. In fact, the photo quailty is so nice I decided to keep the lens despite the small irritation. As other reviews on this lens have noted - it takes some lovely pictures!At roughly $[...] after the $[...] rebate and a six year warranty - the price is extremely competitive. The photo quality is lovely - especially if you enjoy macro work with those beautiful creamy backgrounds. For a 1:1 macro at a comfortable 90mm lens this also is versatile enough to take great pictures of family, friends and the family pet.In the Box:LensLens padded case - drawstringLen cap and back protectorInstructions sheetLens hoodPros:1:1 macroNice photos with a beautiful backgroundAutomatic integrates seemlesslyCompetitive priceBest price with $[...] rebateExtensive warrantyCons:Weird manual/automatic push/pull ringAperature lens adjustment - not thrilled by location or operation in general.Feels a bit "light" [remember, I'm coming from heavy older SLR's]Other Misc Notes:Takes a 55mm filter {less expensive size}. I typically use a UV filter as protection although this sets so far back it almost doesn't need it. I still use one -habit- and also purchased an exexpensive close up filter set to try out.	1
First, it arrived factory sealed without the accessories--no remote, cables, or wall mount.  Samsung was no help and I had to secure the remote and cables at additional expense through a third party.  Then, once it was set-up, the volume capacity (loudness) wa less than the television itself.  I have gone back to using the televion and will send this to Goodwill as soon as I have time.  A total waste of good money.	0

I find it to be a little louder than the Pentax but not to the point of distraction.To switch from automatic to manual requires pushing or pulling a circle around the lens which seemed a bit odd to me - perhaps it is normal but I'm new to the Pentax line and have never used a Tamron lens so it took a few minutes to figure out (the instructions are all but useless - several large drawings in a plethora of languages).Now as to the actual image quality itself...of course being a macro you would expect this to a large extent but just to get a better feel I set up a few "test shots" using both the pentax and the tamron both set at same distance on a couple small objects - a coffee cup, a spider and the fine hairs on a cactus. while both resulted in fine detail and resolution - the tamron really struts its stuff when it comes to the background!As to what I did not like...again, perhaps this is an isolated experience but the first Tamron lens had to be returned due to inability to manually set aperature. The second worked but only in manual mode - would not function in aperature priority mode [Pentax K20D] and it is important to remember to change the settings in the Menu area of the camera body to allow aperature settings on the actual lens [it's the next to last setting on page 6 of 7 for those of you searching for it].Again, being new to Pentax and DSLR's in general perhaps this aperature set-up is more common than I realize [been using plain point and shoot after holding out for years with standard SLR's like the old Maxxum series from Minolata...I know - slow to change]. Even after changing the aperature on the lens it will not display as with all other modes. I was expecting tighter integration although it doesn't seem to impact the quality of the photo itself which is very nice. In fact, the photo quailty is so nice I decided to keep the lens despite the small irritation. As other reviews on this lens have noted - it takes some lovely pictures!At roughly $[...] after the $[...] rebate and a six year warranty - the price is extremely competitive. The photo quality is lovely - especially if you enjoy macro work with those beautiful creamy backgrounds. For a 1:1 macro at a comfortable 90mm lens this also is versatile enough to take great pictures of family, friends and the family pet.In the Box:LensLens padded case - drawstringLen cap and back protectorInstructions sheetLens hoodPros:1:1 macroNice photos with a beautiful backgroundAutomatic integrates seemlesslyCompetitive priceBest price with $[...] rebateExtensive warrantyCons:Weird manual/automatic push/pull ringAperature lens adjustment - not thrilled by location or operation in general.Feels a bit "light" [remember, I'm coming from heavy older SLR's]Other Misc Notes:Takes a 55mm filter {less expensive size}. I typically use a UV filter as protection although this sets so far back it almost doesn't need it. I still use one -habit- and also purchased an exexpensive close up filter set to try out.	1
I purchased this for a project converting slides.  The box clearly states that you can "edit, crop and re-size".  Sorry guys, that software was nowhere to be found.  When contacting the company, they said I got "an older model" and refused to help me.  I will never buy an Innovative Technology device again.  They actually argued with me about what their own box had printed on it.	0
I'm new to the DSLR world and have a Nikon D7000,  Nikon 35mm 1.8 prime, a Sigma 17-50 2.8, and Tokina 11-16 2.8. I like to do garden and food photos and this was the lens I finally decided upon. I compared the Nikon 105 2.8 and the Sigma 150 as well as the Tamron 90mm. I just got it today, poped it on the camera and went to the local garden nursery for a trial spin. The focus isn't as noisy or as loud as I was afraid it would be and auto focus seemed to work fairly well (appx 70 percent of my shots were in focus). The lens does extend with focus, but the barrel does not turn so polarizing filters would work. It feels decent in the hand and the weight is pretty minimal. I pulled up the photos in Lightroom and was impressed with the quality and sharpness for my first time handheld shots. I think I am going to have some fun with this lens. I'll update my review with time.5/4/13 Day two with this lens and I went to manual focusing which is much easier than I thought it would be, funny because everything is so automated these days, I forgot that my eyes work just fine. My photos from today are already tons better than yesterday. When Amazon fixes the customer photo share, I'll put some up.6/18/13 Wow, I am really impressed with this lens. I used it as a telephoto at a local event on an aerialist at our local botanical garden and I LOVE the results.	1
I had no problems installing the drivers, that worked fine. My problem is with the image quality. It's downright terrible. The colors are nowhere near correct, and the gamma is off such that each image comes out extremely bright and washed out.  EVERY image needs editing. The scanner only returns JPEG images, and they're super compressed and full of artifacts. It works nicely, but who cares about that when the image quality is sub par. If you just want images you can share via facebook, it's more than adequate for that. But if you want archival quality scans that you can make prints from in the future, don't waste your money.	0

My wife found this in the clearance bin for ten dollars, and it turned out that even that was too much. The images from this unit are muddy and soft. The colors are not true and the focus plane is not flat. Yuck.This might be something to use when you are desperate to get an old film image into a digital file and quality is not a concern. You will get a digital version that generally resembles the original but not much more.This toy will be added to the next bundle going to Goodwill.	0
Well I picked this up during Christmas season for my gift.  I know, I know...lets get on with the review.  Ok...simply put this is a great lens.  I love taking macro pictures and needed a dedicated macro lens (note if the lens is not a 1:1 it is not a true macro).  It is the middle of winter here in the Chicagoland area, so there are no flowers or bugs to take photos of.  This is when I discovered that when people call this the portrait macro they are not lying.  This lens takes beautiful portrait shots.  Beautiful bokeh.Now to talk about what others say about this lens.  I do not mind the manual/auto focus clutch ring.  I actually like it quite a bit.  The only thing that I noticed is a touch of focus creep sometimes when I am zoomed in fully on a close subject.  That's my only complaint.  Can't wait for winter to go away and I can get my macro on!I would recommend this lens with no reservations...a great lens and a pretty good price.	1
I have scanned large number of slides and use the EPSON 4180 perfection for most.Wanted a quick, small, scanner for the extra job when I did not wanted to use the BIG machine.Fooled me!This is so worthless, wont even spend the money to send it back to Amazon.	0

It does not work properly.  I had to install and uninstall several times for my computer to recognize it.It won't let me scan more than one negative or slide then it froze and had to close program and startagain.  Bottomline, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up returning it.	0
I just received this lens yesterday and my first impression is that this is an amazing piece of glass.  I debated between this, the Nikon 105 and the Tonika 100.  Based on the reviews, price and the ability for this lens to autofocus with a DX camera, I opted for this one.  So far I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  While I will be using this lens primarily for flower macros, I tried it out as a portrait lens as well.  Very nice.  The lens is tack sharp and compared to the Nikkor 105mm a steal of a price.  The auto focus is not as smooth as my Nikon lenses, but for macro work I will not be using it.  The build feels sturdy and I know I will get a lot of use from this.You can check out my test shots in the gallery[...][...]	1
Unit is unacceptable with slides, especially Kodachrome, Kodachrome's dynamic ratio is too much for the scanner in fact most brands of slides have this problem with this scanner.  Highlights are washed out.B/W negatives scan OK, color negatives are poor.If the software would allow manual control of the contrast, color and gamma it would probably be OK.The pictures scan at 1800 dpi or 3600 dpi making file sizes 500 kb or 2000 kb.  The 1800 dpi seems to be as good as 3600 dpi ?The slide and film holders work very well.Software worked with Windows XP 32 bit but didn't work with Windows 7 64 bit.With good software this product might be OK but as sold it is unacceptable.Mine will be returned tomorrow.	0

I bought this Innovative Technology to save money. "You get what you pay for" was never truer.The first review was 5 stars and evidently the father was a senior like me so I thought. Ok. I just think the the father was too kind to tell his child this is a piece of junk.Do like the other review said and buy another one.It is so slow. I did not think any techie thing today could be that slow. It is slow to respond to any click of the mouse for anything. Each slide takes more than a minute to do, probably 1.5 minutes and it is very frustrating. Almost anyone who has slide has hundreds or thousands of them and this is not the device to purchase.I'm sending it back.	0
This is an extremely sharp lens, the image detail in my macro shots is amazing, and the bokeh in my portrait and midrange telephoto shots with it are very, very good.  For the price it has to be one of the best bargains out there.  I own the Tamron 180 macro (also a very good lens, competitive with the Nikon 200 "micro" lens in IQ but cheaper) and for macro work the 90mm is even better.  The 180 gives you more range if you are shooting butterflies and bugs you can't get close to, but if you can get within what is normally considered macro distance of something, this lens surpasses anything I know of.  This lens is superior to 90mm shots with my Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 vr.  Easily superior.The only drawback is that it is not vr, but for macro shots I usually  use it (or any macro lens) with a monopod, sometimes a tripod.  For portrait shots I don't have any problem with hand-held shots, with or without strobes.A great lens.	1
The software written for this product is not good. It does not allow for manual adjustment of focus, lighting, etc, so the slides would come out awful. (ex: lighting would be too bright and wash out faces, scenery) A manual editing software for the initial converting would definitely improve this unit.	0

This item was really frustrating to use at 1st, put it on a PC with Vista and it kept freezing up... this item DOES NOT WORK with Vista! Luckily we had an older computer with XP and it worked fine with that one. As far as image quality... you get what you pay for and this item is by far cheaper then other scanners and it shows! If you don't have a lot of cash and its important to you just to get your old slides and negatives on to your computer then this item will work but don't expect good quality! I have prints of some of my negatives and if I scanned them on a regular flatbed scanner the quality would be by far better then what this thing can do! Some images are greenish, some redish, some old images came out ok and some new images came out looking old. I hate the quality of the images but it is better then nothing until I find a way to get some affordable good quality images elsewhere. As far as the build... it is also cheap, if you aren't careful with this thing it will break! The door broke on ours and later I found out why when I was walking around the room and got the tinyest, sharpest spring stuck in my foot! >:( Clipping together the Slide & Negative loader is also really annoying... the slide loader only takes 3 slides and we scanned 100's so I spent a lot of time clipping and unclipping this thing!	0
This is a lens you should have in your bag and use. This lens is Sharp!!!!! This summer I did a little macro but a lot of model shoots and this lens is perfect. I would buy again and again, you can buy a camers brand lens and pay twice as much and not get a better lens. I don't care what brand of camera my students have, but I tell them the glass is what's counts. Tamron makes this lens for all brands, so buy it.	1
I ordered this eForcity 2 Port USB Travel Charger Adaptor for my ipod. It worked for a few months and it stopped working.	0

Worked great for almost 2 months, but now it's doa. Seller (Eforcity) took care of it. I ordered a Belkin to replace it. The Belkin is much better, but was more money.	0
Much to its credit Tamron has produced one of the best medium telephoto (90mm to 105mm) macro lenses for years of which this SP autofocus 90mm f2.8 DI 1:1 macro lens is no exception. It is optimized to perform best with Nikon's digital SLRs, but will also work well with its film SLRs too. I've read several excellent reports on the internet and photography magazines testifying to its superb contrast and resolution at virtually every aperture. However, I agree with a previous reviewer that the lens has too much of a plastic feel to it, and seems less rugged than the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor. However, if you are on a budget and your photography doesn't include substantial usage in the field, then perhaps this lens could be a viable alternative to the more expensive Micro Nikkor.	1
it's slow to charge and the prong broke off in the wall socket. luckily it was at work so it didn't cost me anything to fix the socket.	0

This product was DOA and returned to Amazon immediately. I can't say whether that was a reflection of the vendor or simply a bad set of chips. Needless to say the process of returning and locating more memory delayed my upgrade by several weeks.	0
The sharpness of this lens simply blows me away.  I do a lot of macro work in wedding photography for my business, but I also love taking this lens out for simple hobby days in nature.  The macro capabilities of this lens are second to none in this focal range, and the performance/price ratio simply can't be beat.A lot of the other reviews have already hit on the highs and lows of the lens, so I won't waste your time by saying the same things over again.  When I was making my macro choice, the two options I landed on were this Tamron and Canon's 100mm L.  I had worked a lot with the Canon 100mm L before (borrowing, renting), and the performance was splendid.  It truly is a remarkable lens.  However, after a session with the Tamron, comparing the Tamron and the Canon side by side, and researching photos/reviews on the web, I found that I could not justify the extra expense for the L glass.  The greatest advantages the L has are the autofocus and weather sealing, in my opinion, and neither of those matter to me as I use manual focus for nearly all of my macro shots and I'm not doing the sort of nature photography that makes weather sealing imperative.I would recommend this lens in a heartbeat as a primary macro lens and an interesting portraiture lens as well.	1
So the whole "Offers complete protection for your Laptop" thing is a joke. It is just an outer shell with no inner foam or soft protection at all. The shell is hard and won't do much to insulate a fall. Just a heads up. I am returning mine!	0

I bought this model on black Friday at Walmart for $99.00 so I could take it to Hawaii for a three week vacation. I loaded a dozen free books from the google site and thought I was good to go. Wrong!! This thing is definitely NOT user friendly. The little user guide only covers how to operate it in general terms and it takes a long, long time until you figure out how to navigate thru it's menu, download books, etc. And then, there is the long, long wait for it to boot up and the sudden freezes of the unit at least once during your reading session. The first two times it froze I was out of luck trying to reset it as I had no needle or pin with which to reset it. On the third day I borrowed a lady's ear ring and used the sharp end to reset it. But, what a terrible time one has attempting to read a book! As far as actually reading from it, it is ok in just about all conditions I tried---in the airport, on the plane, in bright sunlight on Waikiki, etc. If only it were easier to actually get it up and running(it seems to take forever) and then stay running I would enjoy it more.I borrowed a Kindle from a friend and it is a whole different experience. The kindle boots up fast, is easy to see and read and I had no sudden freezes after three days of use.The bottom line: pass on the Sony e-reader and go for what works. buy a kindle for just a little bit more money.	0
This lens is unbelievable.  I've owned many macro lenses before, but this one takes the cake.  It is tack sharp even at f/2.8 and you can get so close its crazy!  I had high expectations, and those were blown away.  I was lucky enough to find it used for just $300.  I consider that a steal for what may very well be the best lens in my bag and its not the only legendary lens in my bag.  I only buy the best glass on the market.  This is no exception.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit loud because it uses the screw drive instead of a HSM to focus.  But thats what you should expect in most 3rd party lenses.  This noise doesn't change my opinion at all.  You can stop your research now.  Go get it!  Well done Tamron.  Well done.	1
I bought this product for my wife because I was able to get it at a significant discount from a bookstore (final purchase price was around $100).  I think other reviewers have adequately criticized the product as not operating very smoothly (another reviewer described it as "quirky").  The software would not install on our desktop machine, so we had to install it on my laptop.  The library software that you're required to use is less than user-friendly.  I might have overlooked all of these issues, but then I was shocked at the cost of the available books.I like the idea of electronic books.  I purchased and enjoyed ebooks on my Palm Tungsten several years ago (back in 2005-2006).  I would have to describe this particular product as no better than a Palm device for that purpose.  The lack of any wireless interface is, in my view, a real problem.  But all of those issues aside -- an electronic book should not cost more than its paper-and-ink counterpart.  Adding insult to injury, I found that books for this device cost more than the same books for a Kindle reader, which can download them electronically.We were able to return the reader to the bookstore with minimal hassle.  If we ever again decide to take the plunge and by an ebook reader, however, we will be sure to check the prices of books before making the purchase.  I would encourage other prospective purchasers to do the same.	0

In two words: it sucks. If there was an opposite to an Apple product - this would be it: slow, quirky, hardly usable. Sony has had e-readers on the market for many years, so I'm very disappointed to find how pathetic this device+software combo is.	0
Back in film days I used the Tamron 90mm f/2.5 macro for portraits and nature photography. Even back then (that was a long time ago!) the Tamron macro had great respect for sharpness and quality at a reasonable price, competing favorably with Nikon's much pricier 105mm f/2.5 macro.When I moved to digital (and Canon) I sought the same performance, and hoped that Tamron hadn't spoiled the reputation earned by their earlier lens.  After all, digital has more demands than film, most notably autofocus and sensor reflectivity.  Plus, the pressure to compete and reduce price is relentless.I was not disappointed - this lens is every bit as sharp as its predecessor.  It's a tiny bit slower, and sometimes you have to help the autofocus if the starting point is way out of focus (this is common for AF macro lenses). But this lens is sharp corner-to-corner (I have an APS camera though, so can't comment on full-frame). IMHO it's a bit long for portraits, especially indoors. But if you have the room, it's excellent for portraits too - the speed, shallow DOF wide open, and the color richness yield gorgeous portraits.Highly recommended.	1
This is my first (and only) eReader, and when Sony came out with this model last September, I bought one since the price was right, well below its main competitor (the Kindle). I wasn't sure if I would enjoy eReading, but I am definitely a fan.Pros:* The device feels great when I hold it, similar to a thin paperback.* The screen display is excellent with regards to clarity.* The eReader feels sturdy, due to its mostly metal exterior.* I've found it easy to use without having to read the manual.* I love being able to have many books available in such a small device.  :)* The price of eBooks seems reasonable to me.* Battery life is excellent.Cons:I use a MacBook Pro, and have found the *integrated experience to be poor*. Sony's Reader Library is now at version 1.1, and it somewhat works (version 1.0 was worse). First, you have to create not one but TWO accounts, one with Sony and one with Adobe, the former to buy eBooks and the latter to get access to the DRM associated with those eBooks (why?!). A hassle, but okay, if it's a one-time necessary evil, so be it. Unfortunately, I recently had problems syncing my paid eBooks on my authorized reader, as well as problems reading my paid eBooks on my authorized laptop, and then ran into problems which required me to de-authorize and authorize the devices again, each time using both aforementioned accounts.It's certainly possible that the PC software is much better than the Mac version, but this weakness is killing the experience for me. I give the device itself very high marks, but since the software is so poor, the entire experience leaves me bland. If the software were brought to up to par, I'd be in eBook heaven.	0

I love reading ebooks on an ebook reader.  The surface of the ebook reader is low glare.  The e-ink has good contrast and decent  resolution making it easy to read.  The buttons are well placed, and their use is rather intuitive.  The body of the ebook reader is light, and the reader itself is small enough to fit in your pocket.This is a simpler ebook reader, which gives it a more accessible price.  I don't hold that against the reader.  It is not trying to be something that it is not.  It has no frills like wi-fi or 3g access.  Instead, you load up books by connecting it to a computer with a USB cable.  You can manage the books on your reader with either the stock Sony software or non OEM support via another application (such as calibre).  It supports several formats including Sony's epub, pdf, plain text, and others.Most of the features of this reader work well in theory and practice.  The only problem is that for me the size of the screen is a bit prohibitive.  My vision is OK; I wear corrective lenses and spend a lot of time during my average day on the computer.  I prefer larger font sizes for comfortable reading (at least 12--14 point fonts).  However, when I increase the font to a level that i find comfortable I find that the screen doesn't actually fit enough text.  I find myself having to flip the page at a rather irritating rate, which interrupts my concentration and distracts me from whatever it is that I am trying to read.This is not likely to be a problem for most people, but you should be aware if your vision is not 20 20, or if you prefer larger font books.  You may be well advised to seek out a larger reader.  I've been eyeing up theKindle DXfor a while now, primarily because of its smaller size.The other (much larger) problem with this reader is its power usage.  Ebook readers typically don't use power unless they are updating the e-ink on the scree, so their charge lasts for quite a while.  I'm not sure why, but for some reason the sony reader uses power while it idles.  I don't know of any way to get the unit to shut down, so if you put it down for long periods of time it will drain dry within a week or so.  If you use it regularly it drains even faster.  Even worse, it needs to charge up before it can be used.  You cannot use it while it is on the charger--it just gives you a screen that shows it is charging.  Eventually when the battery inevitably dies (it happens with all electronics from simple use), I could see how this could render the device unusable.Because of the power issues, I would recommend looking at a different ebook reader.	0
I love the lens, not so sure about how it switches to manual focus but will get use to it. great for portraits.	1
I just purchased the Ignatius Bible-RSV, 2nd Edition by Ignatius Press for $15.36.  I successfully transferred the book to my PRS-300 but the book lacks tabs or quick reference points by which I can jump from one page to another without having to "hit" the forward button several times.  This is awkward and completely useless when trying to use the book as a reference source.  I do not know if this is the publishers fault, a program glitch or me.  I attempted to contact Sony SEVERAL TIMES and continued to get the run around.  So far I have only three books in my Sony e-reader and that is all I intend to do with Sony.  After all the trouble I will switch to Amazon and its Kindle.  Sony does a disservice to their customers by having such poor product support.  I would say that after ten attempts to communicate with them they do not deserve my business.	0

It took me quite a while to get accurate information from Sony but they finally admitted that the useful life of the battery is just over 2 years.  This is what the battery industry considers normal for Lithium Ion batteries and is measured from the date of manufacturer.Now comes the "ka-ching".  The Sony battery is not user changeable and the price Sony gave me to replace the battery is close to $125.  So get ready to pay for this thing all over again in two years.  Oh, here is the bonus.  The charger will not power the unit when the battery dies.  Can you say... "recycle heap"?	0
Pro:- great color, IQ, contrast.- light weight- accurate AF when needed- great MF- well madeNeutral:- AF is slow but ok for a true macro lens. (My Tamron 180mm's AF stopped working in the first week even though I only tested a couple for times and never really used its AF for real at all. Being a tripod macro lens, MF (plus live view zoom in, which is far better than my 1.5/2.5 vertical finder) is a must for me. I hope AF on this one last longer because AF is indeed useful for hand-held quick shots)- price (not cheap for a 3rd party). But with $90 rebate, it's not bad at all.Minor incovenience:- Once the lens is extended, the only way to get it back is to pull back the focus ring and switch to MF and turn the focus to infinite. A quick release mecahnism would be nice. This is a common problem not unique to this Tamron though.- There's only one position the hood and back cap can be attached to the lens, a Tamron design. This design makes the attachment much stronger but much more hassle to attach in the first place. I much prefer Canon or Sigma's in this regard. I've never had accident with Canon or Sigma lenses when the hood or back cap accidentally fell off. (Correction - just had the precious hood on the Sigma 12-24 "bulb" off without noticing it in the bag, with the bulb completely exposed, which scared the day light out of me! But again that is the front cap not the rear one. To be care, I think Tamron does do a better job at designing their caps. Now I am so much more used to the Tamron way of doing things - just aim the special area (feel it with your finger) of the Tamron rear cap at the red dot on the lens, that is where the cap hooks up with the lens.)- switching AF/MF produces a loud click sound. The switch can only happen at certain positions. My Sigma 20mm/f1.8 got a better design - I can switch any time, the switch is much more smoother. Tokina 11-16 is also smoother. Don't have the Tokina 100mm macro to compare with, though.Bottom line:I have the Tamron 180mm macro, great when mounted on a solid platform, not great hand held - too big and heavy. This one fills the gap. The small size and light weight is perfect to be carried around with other lenses on routine outings. Like other Tamrons, this one is plastic all the way (hence the light weight), but well made, MF ring is well damped with plenty rotation for fine tuning. I was a bit unsure about the closest focus distance on this one, turns out it's plenty for real wold use. The protruding front element is not a problem in real world use at all (as oppose to Internal Focus of the Canon 100mm Macro, or the Tamron 180mm ). In short, this is a perfect hand-held macro/portrait lens.Update: this is fantastic tele as well if you are in no hurry. The IQ is just breathtaking. Tried Canon 100mm macro in store the other day, the Canon AF and build quality are better. But if you only use this sort of lens once in a while, you might want to save your buck here because this lens is for real.	1
Like so many other reviewers, it's a nice device until...I think too many people review a product during the first days of owning it, when the excitement of a new toy clouds their objective opinion.I bought two of these for my wife and me a year ago. We experienced battery issues similar to other reviews. Within a month the battery on my wife's unit wouldn't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. Mine is still okay over a year later, although will only charge to about 50% original capacity. Both units were used under similar conditions and duration.However, what really cripples these devices is the software and DRM on the ebooks. We tried to transfer the ebooks from my wife's failing device to mine. No good. To make a long story short, we had to buy all new books at about $10 each. The software is cumbersome and is very much like itunes, which I hate. You can only sync one unit, to one library.It's not all bad. The screen looks really good and you can easily read in direct sunlight, as advertised. You can also view your own files such as MS-Word and PDF. However, PDFs from scanned images can't be resized, so don't think you are scanning in any old paperbacks.In summary, if you are single user and don't plan on sharing ebooks, lucky enough not to get a unit with a bad battery, or not planning on buying a lot of ebooks, this isn't a terrible product...it's just not a very good one.	0

I am an expert what it comes to gadgets and technology.  I have had many digital cameras, camcorders, camera phones and so much more over the years.  This is the most unintuitive and hard to use device I can remember.FIRST IMPRESSIONSUpon opening the cheap feeling packaging, I found the camera to have a cheap look and feel, but maybe that's after being used to iPod Touches and iPhones.  Looking on the device, it has a screw hole for a tripod, a headphone jack, a power button, a video/photo button, trash button, mini-HDMI port and a nicely designed fold-up USB "cord."  On the front is a record button and plus, minus, fast forward, reverse and play/pause places to touch.USABILITYTurning it on, I found the letters and graphics to be very cheesy, like an 8 year old digital camera.  Taking a video was straightforward.  Figuring out how to watch it took some fiddling, since I'm used to a record/play switch or button on digital cameras.  On this you hit the play/pause button, which automatically plays the video you just took.The + and - and fast-forward and reverse buttons and play/pause are just "touch" areas with no feel whatsoever.  I find these to be just awful.  You are almost going to need to be looking to use them.Next I wanted to set the time and date and maybe some preferences.  I couldn't figure out how to do it.  A menu button would be customary in these devices, but there was none to be found..  I finally figured out that you hold down the video/camera button for 2 seconds.  You almost need to attach a quick reference guide to the camera to know how to use it...VIDEO QUALITYI did a few tests and found the video quality, on HD mode, to be ok, but nothing worth getting excited about.  After all, the lens can be measured in millimeters.  On the computer with the video file and HDTV via HDMI, it was not as crisp and clear as larger HD camcorders, but it would be perfectly acceptable as a YouTube video.  It may have HD resolution, but I doesn't qualify in my mind as an HD-quality picture (which has more than a technical meaning).In comparison with the iPhone 3GS, the video was of higher quality with the Vado, and I didn't notice a huge difference in how it handled low lighting.EASE OF TRANSFERRINGThis is a high point of this device.  The built-in USB "cord" is genius and hopefully will be adopted by more devices.  It has a program that can be installed, but Windows can just get the videos directly, which is great.  If only all devices made it so easy.Overall, the so-so video quality and awful usability will make my camera go back it the box.I think this category of digital video recorders cannot withstand the onslaught of phones that will be able to do the same thing without carrying extra devices.	0
Very happy with this lens.  I am using it on a Sony NEX-7 with the LA-EA2 adapter which means it autofocuses as well.  It is a nice size, stable lens which balances easily on the smallish Sony.	1
Bought this over a year ago and only used it a few times. When I got to a place I wanted to use it (probably the 2nd or third time I ever used it), I took it out of the bag and the battery was 99% dead. I thought it was weird but maybe I accidentally pressed a button and it turned on, draining the battery while in my bag. Thought nothing of it and haven't used it again until now (a year later). Well now it won't even TURN ON. If I plug it into the computer it says it's charging, and then it shows a full battery sign. Unplug it from the computer and it won't turn on at all. It is GARBAGE, don't waste your money. Biggest waste of $140 ever. I have heard other people had similar problems with the battery and this unit never turning on. I will never trust "Creative" again. Such a short life span is ridiculous.	0

I followed the directions and charged the cam for a full 8+ hours.  It would only turn on if it was plugged into the usb port.  I went onto Creative's support site and right there in writing was a supposed solution to this common problem.  The recommendation was to download the most up-to-date firmware, which I did.  It still wouldn't turn on.  I went onto the message forum for this product and there were two pages of people with the same issue.  ([...]).  I was ready to return this to Amazon until I read on the forum that the battery needs to have the writing side UP!  It now works just fine!  Creative did not make it clear how the battery should be installed and I feel silly for not knowing.Update:  The video on this was so jumpy that you could barely see what was being filmed so I've changed my rating.  I decided to purchase the Kodak PlaySport HD ZX3 Waterproof Pocket Video Camera instead.  The Kodak was far superior to and submersible to 10'.	0
After using a Canon DSLR for about 5 years, I switched to Pentax. In switching, I was presented with a unique opportunity. I had no lenses. Because I sold off all my Canon gear, I had a good chunk of change to throw at some new gear. I had the Canon version of this lens for the 5 years I used Canon. In those 5 years, the amazing optical quality and performance of this lens made it a staple in my camera bag. After using it in rough situations for 5 years, the build quality was revealed to be outstanding.It was because of my five years of experience using this lens that I bought it again for Pentax.Rather than a pros and cons list, I'll list a few of the features of the lens so you can decide if you would use it the same way. I think most lenses aren't built with pros and cons, they are just suited to different shooting situations and environments.The lens is 90mmWith the 1.5 magnification on my k10d, this lens is effectively a 135mm macro lens. This suits me just fine for my subject matter - typically insects, flowers, and textures. The lens also functions beautifully as a portrait lens, and the f2.8 give a beautiful bokeh. 135mm is longer than some prefer for portrait photography, however, so keep that in mind when you read praises in that regard.The automatic to manual focus ringThis lens features a large ring to switch between manual and automatic focus. When I first used the lens, it seemed a bit awkward. As I used the lens in the field, however, I quickly grew to love this feature. Most people will say that macro photography doesn't require autofocus. That may be fine for some, but I really appreciate being able to use the autofocus to get the focus very close to what I want, then shift to manual focus to accomplish exactly what I want. It saves me time. With subjects that are hopping from leaf to leaf, its has been the difference between missing a shot and getting a shot.There is a limitOne frustration I've found with the lens for a portrait is the length of the focus. If the autofocus goes past your subject, it goes to 1:1, then works it's way back. This can be very tedious. Fortunately, the lens comes with a 'limiter' that you can switch on. This prevents the lens from traveling its whole distance before coming back. Keep in mind that while the lens can take some nice portraits, it is designed to be a macro lens. Because of that, it isn't the quickest focusing lens in my bag by far. If you know that going in, you can work within its limitations to get some solid shots.Build qualityThe build quality is good on this lens. It is made of plastic, so it doesn't have the unbreakable feel of some older macro lenses, but I feel comfortable using it in a variety of situations. Some of that is based on my experience with the same lens in Canon. I expect this lens to serve me just as well.SharpnessI value sharpness higher than any other quality when it comes to a macro lens. And that is why the Tamron 90mm lens, not the Pentax 100mm macro lens is in my bag. Every review has them close, but the Tamron always gets a slight edge. In all of the situations I've used the lens, I have been more than pleased with the results. Beyond sharpness, I have also been very happy with the color rendition of this lens.As someone who primarily shoots macro photography, this is a lens that will always be in my bag.	1
Error message?! Took too long to wait for a return, my bad. Next time will test sooner. Turns on, but shows no image just error message. Got it used on AMAZON.	0

When I received this product I shocked to see the quality, very poor construction. I believe in creative products but this is very unsatisfied product.	0
(Another year and one repair later, I still love this lens. Original review first followed by updates.)First impression: right out of the box, this lens is smaller than I pictured. I had experience with the Sigma 105mm, and this is easily smaller and lighter. For travel purposes, it is ideal, plastic build or not.I did get a few surprises when I put it on the camera (D70), so anyone thinking about purchasing this lens should pay attention. This info is already out there, I just didn't notice and was almost disappointed at first.1: This lens is only 2.8 at 10 feet to infinity. The maximum aperture drops as you focus closer, and at minimum focusing distance, where many will want to work to get the true 1:1, it is all the way down to 5.6. That was quite a shock at first, but I soon found that at such close range, even 5.6 gives you very shallow depth of field. It just means less speed, so a tripod will almost always be necessary unless you are really good at hand-holding.2: The switch between auto and manual focus requires you to push or pull the focus ring. I should have known this after working with the Sigma 105mm, but it is not obvious on this lens and I had to check the instructions. lol.Again, this information is in other reviews, and it may be obvious to most users, but anyone new to macro should keep it in mind to avoid any surprises.UPDATE: I've left off the old review taken from my first few shots, as I have much more experience to pull from now.This lens captures beautiful photos, that much is certain. I have not tested the Nikon 105mm VR lens, but from the examples I've seen, this lens can still hold its own, even without VR. (I used to think VR was meaningless on a macro lens, but I have found many times when it would be useful.)Strong points:* Bokeh (out of focus rendering) is stunning* Color is rich (super color with D70, can't wait to see what it does with a D300!)* Lens is light, less than half the weight of the Nikon 105mm VR* Focus ring is large and easy to useWeak points:* Auto-focus is slow, noisy, and hunts a bit at times* Lens is not fixed length, short when focusing at infinity, extends out when focusing closer, a significant amount* Plastic build (doesn't bother me, but some don't like it)For my money, the pros far outweigh the cons here. I use this lens a lot for product photography (at work), non-macro flower and other small items, but I almost never take it all the way to 1:1 because I'm often too lazy to get out the tripod, or not in a situation where a tripod is usable.One thing to note: auto-focus has recently started acting up on my D70. For a few weeks it would refuse to auto-focus, I would reboot the camera, take the lens off and put it on again, and it would start working until I turned the camera off once more. Most recently I have not been able to get the auto-focus to work at all. (It is the only lens in my kit that does this, so I don't believe it is the camera.) Since the auto-focus is always slow anyway, I've taken to keeping it in manual focus and just dealing with it. It's a hassle at times, but it does not detract from my enjoyment of this lens.UPDATE #2: Tamron warranty and service are incredible!As mentioned above, the auto-focus eventually stopped working completely with both my D70 and D300. All Tamron USA lenses come with a 6 year warranty (6 years!) so I printed a receipt off Amazon, filled out a simple form, and put it in the mail. A couple weeks later I received notice that it was being repaired, no charge of course, and it gave me an order number to track it.I was leaving on a trip a few days later and didn't want it sitting outside my house while I was gone, so I contacted Tamron service department to see if I could change the shipping address. It had already shipped out and would be at my house within the week. Unlucky for me it arrived the day I left, but I had someone take it inside for me the next day, so no worries. It has been tested and works perfectly! 5 additional stars for Tamron's repair department!I would recommend this lens to anyone wanting to do macro work, portraiture, product photography, or any not-quite-macro nature shots with lots of color.	1
I bought this keyboard because I wanted backlit, without breaking the bank.The first one of these broke within a week of using it, half the keys didn't work.The replacement that was sent, the backlit went out within a week.	0

The way some of the keys are laid out on the keyboard are awkward. The backspace key is the same size as a letter key. Some of them are just not the same size or in the same place as a traditional keyboard. The letter keys have the same layout but other keys don't. I would not recommend this product. It is frustrating to reach for one key and hit a different one because of placement/key size.	0
This is an excellent choice if you're interested in close-up and macrophotography -- it's sharp corner-to-corner, and you get life-size photos down to the size of a large bug.  Usually you end up focusing macro shots manually, and the Tamron manual focus ring travels about 270 degrees, giving lots of smooth fine-tuning capability.For portraits and medium telephoto shots, the autofocus capability works well but it's audible.  You can set a limiting switch so that it won't hunt through the entire range, from 8" to infinity.  It's easy to switch from autofocus to manual by feel -- you can do it without moving your eye from the viewfinder.There are probably better choices if you want to do portraits first and macrophotography second -- Canon's 100mm and Sigma's 105mm macros, in particular, but the Tamron is an excellent choice for macro work.The lens body is plastic, so it's lighter than OEM lenses from Canon & Nikon.  The light weight makes one wonder about how rugged it is, but it feels well put together, and anyway you shouldn't be using a lens to drive nails.Note that the 90mm designation applies only to full frame SLRs.  On digital SLRs like the Canon 300D & 350D or the Nikon D50 & D70, the lens gives you an effecive focal length of about 130mm.  So you get a bit more working distance for macro subjects, but you may have to stand back too far from the subject for portraiture.	1
I had some high hopes that this would be an answer to not seeing your keys in low lightworking situations. Well it does do that if you can take the annoying light that makes your eyes seem like your viewing a 3d movie with those cyan & red  glasses. They even put an extra back slash key to the right of your alt key on the left side that doesn't feel good being there. My son saw the keyboard and so I gave him one and he likes it, but told me the keys are a little loose for his taste. You can turn off the blue light but the white is not clear or bright enough to really use. It is a great idea that needs a better design. I mean it was only $18 what do you expect.	0
This is an excellent choice if you're interested in close-up and macrophotography -- it's sharp corner-to-corner, and you get life-size photos down to the size of a large bug.  Usually you end up focusing macro shots manually, and the Tamron manual focus ring travels about 270 degrees, giving lots of smooth fine-tuning capability.For portraits and medium telephoto shots, the autofocus capability works well but it's audible.  You can set a limiting switch so that it won't hunt through the entire range, from 8" to infinity.  It's easy to switch from autofocus to manual by feel -- you can do it without moving your eye from the viewfinder.There are probably better choices if you want to do portraits first and macrophotography second -- Canon's 100mm and Sigma's 105mm macros, in particular, but the Tamron is an excellent choice for macro work.The lens body is plastic, so it's lighter than OEM lenses from Canon & Nikon.  The light weight makes one wonder about how rugged it is, but it feels well put together, and anyway you shouldn't be using a lens to drive nails.Note that the 90mm designation applies only to full frame SLRs.  On digital SLRs like the Canon 300D & 350D or the Nikon D50 & D70, the lens gives you an effecive focal length of about 130mm.  So you get a bit more working distance for macro subjects, but you may have to stand back too far from the subject for portraiture.	1
I tried it for an hour then went back the my old keyboard.  In a well lit room the blue backlit keys can't be seen, also I didn't like the keyboard style, some keys ars smaller and in different places.  I don't have time for the learning curve.  Quality was about average, but good for the price.  Also, you need to be directly over the keyboard to see the lighted letters, any angle and you don't see the illumination at all.	0
This is a great lens.  Before purchasing, I though it was a bit pricey for what I intended which was close up macro photography.  After several years of use, this lens is a staple in my bag.  I'm not a pro photographer but shoot very frequently and this is my go-to lens for portraits and close up work.For those new to photography, this lens can be used for both Nikon DX and FX digital cameras.  It produces wonderful bokeh.  Bokeh is the creative blur effect that is generated when your subject is in focus in the foreground and the background blurs.  Many factors play a part in how effective this blur is.  On the Tamron 90mm, the bokeh is reliably great.  It makes closeup work and portrait work look very professional.I've had the fortune to use this lens alongside the Nikon 105mm equivalent.  Build quality on the Nikon is hands down superior.  This lens has the feel of amateur glass while the Nikon is very solid and heavy.  In general, Nikon lenses are the reason I purchase a D700 but this lens is an exception.  For 1/4 the price of the Nikon, this lens is an unbelievable value.  It's lightweight but I've been using mine for four years with no issues.  The lens also holds it's value which speaks to it's performance and quality.In short, if you're looking for a value pro lens, look no further.My credentials: I've been a self proclaimed amateur photographer for over 15years and have owned a lot of gear.  Anything that does not make the cut goes to ebay. I don't ever foresee selling this lens.	1

I had high hopes for this keyboard because of how many good reviews it got. I don't know where the reviews came from because it wasn't good. The keyboard feel is actually so bad that I am returning it. The layout is iffy but I'm sure I could have gotten used to the small delete key and the row of buttons next to enter. The main problem I had was that the keyboard wasn't balanced, I had to use the feet to even remotely balance it but without the feet down, it wobbled like it was missing a pad underneath (even though it wasn't).The backlighting on the keyboard was great, it was very bright and shone through the keys very well. but the keys do look generic. The keyboard was very loud and not very responsive, so rule gaming out, and although the weight of the keyboard felt solid, the keys felt very cheap and thin. All in all, it felt like a cheap keyboard, despite the good reviews.I understand that this is a no-name keyboard but for 30 bucks I expected a lot more... Considering I can just wait for a real keyboard to go on sale for 36 or so (Logitech, Saitek, even Microsoft...) this is an awful deal. For the time being I am switching back to my good old faithful 8 year old Compaq PS/2 keyboard, even if it looks hilarious plugged into a gaming rig... But hey at least it has a Sleep button.Hope this review helped!	0
This is my first macro lens, and I am very pleased with it. It is well-made, light, and the optics are tack-sharp. My intention is to do macro nature photography (insects, spiders,...), and so far it has been a pleasure to use.  Before buying it, I read in many user forums that the minimum focusing distance of a 90mm macro lens such as this one (12 inches) is too close for photographing skittish subjects such as butterflies. I could have moved up to a 150mm macro lens, which would add 3 inches to the distance, but at the cost of a much narrower depth of field, as well as a heavier lens requiring a tripod. I opted for the Tamron 90mm, after seeing some excellent insect photographs online. But one word of caution: the minimum 12 inch distance is measured from the focal plane at the back of the camera (as is always the case when measuring focal distances). When the lens is fully extended, you might have about 3 or 4 inches between the front of the lens and the subject (and that's without a lens hood). Hence this is definitely a close distance for skittish insects! Nevertheless, this is part of doing business with a macro lens... short focusing distances, and extremely narrow fields of view. Because you'll usually want to step the lens down as far as possible, you will either need fast-moving subjects in full sunlight, or you'll need to use an external flash. Unfortunately, the built-in pop-up flash of digital SLR's will cause a shadow through the middle of the picture at short macro-length distances.In any case, this is a great macro lens for a novice or pro.	1
Don't buy it because it has a LED backlight !At first I think it's cool as I can see the keys in darkness, but things changed as it arrived. Manufacture wants to save the cost so they put keys together, as tight as they can !!! you will never feel familiar the the keys layout, the direction key has been moved into a tiny place where you can't even feel them when you need them ! The keyboard I got is even more funny. The "ESC" key loves playing peekaboo so much that it won't come out every time when you press it(I press not that hard, but just enough to make the electric capacity can form the signal). It never pops up unless I press tyhe Tab key.Throw it back to amazon as Logitech K350 is way better than this, even through it does not have LED back light.	0

I've used the W-9868BK for a few months now. The first thing I noticed was the cheap flimsy feel it has. I had to prop one corner with a bit of folded paper just to get it to stay level. The backlight is barely sufficient, and is needed during the day because the blue lettered keys are nearly invisible without backlight. I just switched to a Cyborg V.5 keyboard for $10.00 more, and really wish I'd done it three months ago. The Cyborg is much sturdier, better key action, and light lettering for much better visibilty. It also allows light adjustment and volume control. Spend an extra 10 bucks. I wish I had.	0
I wanted to get into macro photography and decided on Tamron because of the rebate offer.  I was truly blown away on how sharp this lens performed. It has also double as a great portrait lens.  On my Rebel XT, the focal length actual equals 144mm which gives great heads shots.  The focusing is slightly slow but that didn't bother me any.  Once you look at the results from this lens you it's a no brainer.	1
Terrible keyboard. Stupid layout. Light leaks between the rows of keys glinting in my eyes. I hate everything about this.	0

Not withstanding the affordable price I cannot recommend this keyboard. First off the key layout is very "non-standard". Then, is you are hoping for something you can see in a dim area, forget this. The key characters are a dark cobalt blue. Yes, they are illuminated, but still barely visible.	0
Stop thinking about what macro lens to buy.This one is better then the most expensives Canon lenses.The images are very good and the price is excellent!Go on and take very good macro and close-up photos!	1
This keyboard is not very well lit, and the light is needed even in daylight because of the way the keys are labled.  There are numerous keys in odd places, the backspace and delete keys are particularly hard to use due to the unusual location and a "home" key where the backspace key belongs.  The spacebar does not work easily, I have to press too hard on it.  I should have spent the extra money and bought a better one!	0

The title says it all. But I'm happy with the one I got becauseIts full size with seperate arrow buttons and number padFull size backspace keyLights up white instead of blueHas a stand alone power button (for lights) instead of using the numlock keyCouldn't find a brand name anywhere on it looks very similar to the one in the preview but full sized instead of compact. Very nice lighting also the white looks much more professional than blue. My brother has the blue saitek keybourd which is also full sized but the blue lighting looks more gamer to me than anything.The only thing I dont like about it is the feel of the keys. There surface feels like your touching spray painted primer but besides that love it. Gave it 4 stars only because they should match what there sending you with the picture.UPDATE: It died after about 6 weeks some keys stopped working. I kept it around for awhile to see if it would come back, it didn't.	0
I have a Pentax K5, and been using the lens now for several days both in macro and standard mode. I use Paint and blow up the macro mode shots to see the detail and they are quite remarkable in sharpness and detail along with beautiful soft bokeh. Have yet to see any CA, and the corners are sharp.I use manual focusing for the macro mode and shoot in good light using center point focusing and get great results.  Needless to say, in macro mode you don't get much depth of field, but that's to be expected.  The standard shots using auto focus is fine, nothing exceptional.I've read where others mentioned that the zoom makes a lot of noise, I have Pentax DA lens, and to be honest, I don't think the Tamron is noisy and it's just as fast when properly set up.I follow the Tamron instructions set up for both manual macro shots (limit) and standard auto focusing (full), and in good light the lens doesn't hunt and focusing is fast.  That's really the key, good light.  Any auto focusing lens will hunt in low light.For the money, you can't do any better and the Tamron compares quite well to the Pentax 100 mm macro on the Pentax Forum for a lot less money.  BTW, I bought mine used, actually, it looks more like an open box item.	1
Thought a PCI adapter with 2 antennae would help with the signal. Wrong! it didn't at all! This adapter gets no better signal than my old single band wireless N USB connector! Big waste of money. I could return it but to disassemble the PC and pull it out is a pain since a million cables connect to my pc.	0

I chose this wireless N adapter back when it was shiny and new. The antenna sockets regularly disconnected from the board. This ruined my BFBC2 sessions. GRR.	0
Great 1:1 macro lens! Great portrit lens!  Has some degree of difficulty finding focus in dark or complicated lighting situations, but if you're shooting it as a macro, you're manually focusing anyways, so no loss there. I've used this lens for Wedding shoots and for Wakeboarding shots, and it's performance in well lit scenarios is pretty good for a lens that's not designed for that type of photography!  Here's the reason I bought it... Ring shots for weddings. And it's the prefect lens for that job! It just happens to be a great lens all around!  And until recently, has saved me from buying an 85mm lens for portraiture, but I wanted more light, so I finally broke down and bought an 85 anyways.... But both lenses will remain in my bag o' goodies!Bottom Line.... Perfect Macro with the ability to handle other situations better than you'd imagine!	1
Installed the card and like several users received a Blue Screen shortly after Windows loading screen. Tried several suggestions offered here and on boards, nothing would make it work. BUT.... I did solve my problem: I sent it back for a refund.	0

I tried these video cards with a micro computer, the video quality left much to be desired. Its almost impossible to get them to work with win 7. Simple little computer, meant for controlling a swimming pool system online.	0
This is my first non-Canon lens, and I have to say after a couple days I love it.  I have a lot to learn about macro photography of course, but thats why you buy a lens like this in the first place.This will take some work, and will be very fun...I would buy this lens again, as matter of fact, I will probably pick up a Tamron wide angle as this lens is great.  Can't beat a 60 Dollar rebate too... Put my price under 4 bills!!Rp	1
I was hoping to use this in my WHS 2011 server setup. The PCIe x8/16 slots were taken up by SAS cards and I have 3 PCIe x1 slots. This card did not work with my GIGABYTE Z68X-UD3-B3 Motherboard. I could not find any drivers that would make this work and searches on Google were spotty on the subject especially with these MB's.  I am going to try the Radeon card to see if it works.	0

I got this for my son because I thought it would be a great idea to have an alarm clock where he could also play his music.  It ended up being a pain.

I just received this lens today and after initially checking the lens for any focus problems with a Datacolor Lens Cal (fortunately there weren't any) I made a short field trip to try this lens out. I was very happy with the results. In my title I mentioned some quirks that this lens has and if you decide to buy one pay close attention to instructions, especially if you buy this for a Pentax or Sony.  First is the ridiculous way the lens has to be changed from AF to manual. To put it into manual the focus ring has to be pulled backwards then the camera has to be set to manual focus. I don't know why when the focus ring is pulled back the screw dive doesn't disengage but that's the way it is designed. If you don't put the camera in MF and you try to focus the lens and/or the camera can be damaged. This is mentioned in the instructions and this little fact should be high lighted much better.  The limiter is very good though. For general photography set it to full.  If you want 1:1 the distance scale has to set to .29 meters then set the limiter. This prevents hunting. The range here is from .29 to .4 meters, where at .29 it's 1:1, at .35 the image size is 1:2.  For normal photos the distance scale has to set at .45 then set the limiter. Be aware with this setting you can't do close up or macro but it will reduce hunting. On the very positive side this lens is incredibly sharp, even at 2.8 and as that nut case Kai on Digital Rev would say it is &#34;bokehlicous&#34;.  Especially for closeups good bokeh is essential this lens delivers.  I couldn't get any high contrast pics because of cloud cover and haze so I can't comment on CA's but Photozone does give this lens very high marks. They did test it on a K-5. The contrast and color seem to be very good too but because current weather conditions I'll have to wait a few days to check again.  Finally, I did buy this lens used and was rated &#34;like new&#34; and it is. Beautiful condition, nary a mark on it including the mount. That pleases me immensely as well as the excellent price.	1
I have several speedrings for Bowens/Calumet lighting and this is by far the most difficult one to set up and especially break down. The rods just won't come out of the darn thing.From now on I'm buying more expensive rings which have a marked 'last hole' which is a little bigger than the rest to facilitate setup and breakdown.	0

I've always wanted a good macro lens for small subjects and really up close photography.  I finally decided to pull the trigger and buy the Tamron 90mm f/2.8 Di macro.  This is a beautiful lens that looks good on my Pentax K5 camera.  I was pleased with the way it operates.  Auto focusing is smooth and quiet.  Images taken were clear and sharp with good color rendition.  No distortions of any kind were seen and the viewfinder image was bright and clear, utilizing its large/fast f/2.8 lens opening.The lens will autofocus down to about 10".  Closer than that, and you will need to switch to manual focus.  At those very close distances the depth of field is so shallow, autofocus would not be critical enough anyways.  I do not keep the lens on my camera all the time.  For my all around lens, I prefer a fast zoom lens like my Tamron 70-300 zoom.The Tamron 90mm macro is also the perfect lens for portrait work.  It will provide a terrific bokah effect and is just the right focal length for flattering portraits.I don't think you can go wrong buying this lens.  Tamron has been making lenses for as long as I can remember.  I have owned many of them and have never had a problem.PROS:1.  THE lens for macro work.2.  Solid construction, great optics and lens coatings.3.  Hood and lens caps included.4.  Metal lens mount.5.  Perfect for Portrait work.6.  Low cost compared to the higher price of the major manufacturers lens'.7.  Internal focusing.8.  Standard size filter ring.9.  Tamron quality, one year warrantee.10. Looks great on the camera.11. Fast f/2.8 lens opening.CONS:1.  Lens is not waterproof.  Don't take it out in the rain.2.  May not be the same quality optically or mechanically as the more expensive Nikon or Canon L lenses, but not necessarily so.3.  Lens does not come with a storage bag.I am so pleased with this lens, that I am kicking myself for not buying it sooner.	1

This item is listed as being a charger for the DMC-FZ28, it does not fit the batteries for that camera. The batteries fall out of the charger. I have requested a return, I'm waiting for approval and a shipping label The price was low, but it is still totally wasted money.	0
I'd first like to thank the other reviewers here for their precise and comprehensive analyses of this lens, with special thanks to "Capt RB". Your comments were very instrumental in my deciding to purchase this lens, and I'm VERY glad I did! My experience with this superb optic has been identical to most of yours; likewise my opinion of this product, as well. So much so that in place of a lengthy and verbose review of my own (and I fully intended to write one, too!), I'll simply say "Ditto!" , but with just a few added comments:1. This lens is not only sharper than the Nikon 105 2.8 micro, but it's MUCH sharper!2. Overall IQ, in my opinion, is superior to the 105 2.8 Nikkor in every way that matters to me...color, contrast, raw resolution and fine detail, brightness and color saturation, a complete absence of any and all linear distortions, freedom from purple fringing and insignificant levels of secondary chromatic aberations. And need I even mention its substantially better rendering of out of focus elements, or bokeh as it's often called.Bottom line: I haven't seen image quality like this since I last held a Leica in my hands!3. Build quality (which cost Tamron that highly coveted "5th star") is just barely adequate; reminiscent more of Nikons 55-200mm budget tele-zoom lens rather than their micro-nikkors. But I'm more than willing to live with it's flimsy construction in exchange for its absolutly stellar image quality. I'm just going to have to be very, very careful how I handle, transport, and store it. Consider her, if you will, as one might a fine Patek Phillipe timepiece...too fragile to take on safari, but of utterly stunning, world class performance.This one shortcoming notwithstanding, I would opt for this lens every time!&lt;UPDATE!> After using this lens quite extensively for the past few weeks, I'd like to point out a few important things that weren't immediately apparent when first using it.My copy of this outstanding lens features Tamrons most recent improvement to its already  classic design, namely the addition of the built-in autofocus drive motor. It is noteworthy that the few negative criticisms to be found in other reviews of this lens, specifically regarding slow or noisy AF, all appear to apply only to those models that use the camera bodys AF drive motor and not to this newest version. I do have one such lens, the Nikon 70-300mm G, and if it's any example of screw-drive autofocus performance, then such criticisms are most likely well deserved.As for auto-focus speed with the built in AF motor, let me tell you that when restricted to its 'non macro' range (1.5' - Inf.) this puppy is not just fast, but REALLY fast! Outdoors with my Nikon D90, in any reasonable level of 'daytime' lighting, autofocus is achieved in a blink of an eye, and with utterly no 'hunting'. It focuses faster than my AFS 16-85mm VR Nikkor, and even a little quicker than the 50mm 1.8 AF-D, and much quieter. Incidently, focus accuracy at ANY distance is 'dead on' accurate! And unlike quite a number of macro optics, it's also critically sharp at any distance, too. Between the fast, quiet, and accurate focusing,  this lens is actually quite useful when action stopping shutter speeds are necessary. While certainly more than adequate for capturing a visit to the 'dog park' or kids at play, I don't know that I'd reccommend it for shooting nighttime jai-lai matches by available light but then, this lens wasn't designed for that purpose.In more typical 'Macro' applications, autofocus while neither as fast or quiet as previously mentioned, is quite respectable and most of all, resolute and precise.Over these last few weeks with this lens, I've also come to re-evaluate its build quality. I put it somewhat above the Nikkor kit lenses, but still a little below my 16-85mm VR Nikkor zoom, the 18-200 VR Nikkor, or the AFS 70-300 VR Nikkor. Considering that this Tamron 90mm 2.8 Macro lens costs about half what those others do, I'd now be more inclined to say that while not "Press Corp" rugged, it's build quality and construction are certainly adequate for such purposes as it was made. And, yes...I'd reccommend it again and again!So, okay...let's give her another 1/4 star!	1

I'd first like to thank the other reviewers here for their precise and comprehensive analyses of this lens, with special thanks to "Capt RB". Your comments were very instrumental in my deciding to purchase this lens, and I'm VERY glad I did! My experience with this superb optic has been identical to most of yours; likewise my opinion of this product, as well. So much so that in place of a lengthy and verbose review of my own (and I fully intended to write one, too!), I'll simply say "Ditto!" , but with just a few added comments:1. This lens is not only sharper than the Nikon 105 2.8 micro, but it's MUCH sharper!2. Overall IQ, in my opinion, is superior to the 105 2.8 Nikkor in every way that matters to me...color, contrast, raw resolution and fine detail, brightness and color saturation, a complete absence of any and all linear distortions, freedom from purple fringing and insignificant levels of secondary chromatic aberations. And need I even mention its substantially better rendering of out of focus elements, or bokeh as it's often called.Bottom line: I haven't seen image quality like this since I last held a Leica in my hands!3. Build quality (which cost Tamron that highly coveted "5th star") is just barely adequate; reminiscent more of Nikons 55-200mm budget tele-zoom lens rather than their micro-nikkors. But I'm more than willing to live with it's flimsy construction in exchange for its absolutly stellar image quality. I'm just going to have to be very, very careful how I handle, transport, and store it.

I am not a professional but an avid amateur enthusiast, this lens is really unbelievable.  This is the first non-Nikon lens I have bought and I have been using it for about 14 months.It is lightweight and sharp end to end, it does a very good job on macrophotography.  It tends to hunt a bit when set to full focus, but that can be expected because of the large focal range.For portraits and very tight close-ups I absolutely love this lens.  The image quality and sharpness is out of this world.  The design of the focus ring makes it very easy to switch between manual and auto focus, which is probably one of the better design features of this lens.It feels a little cheap because of the polymer construction but it is inexpensive and very lightweight so it makes it easy to walk around with.I tested before buying.  I used the nikkor 105mm macro and the Sigma 105, the nikkor has a better feel construction wise (for 3x the price) but I could not tell a difference in performance.  I felt this lens performed much better than the Sigma 105mm.I own 5 lenses this is one that I always carry with me and when you get it, it will always be in your camera bag.	1
It fell apart after a few months of usage. Even though I used it fairly lightly. Aside from build quality, the look and feel is not that great either.	0

These fit my nikon flashes so poorly that they were unusable and would trigger randomly if the flash tilted.  Oh well, it was worth a shot.  They may fit other brands properly.	0
I use this lens with my new Canon T3i and have taken some amazingly TACK sharp and spectacular macro bug and spider photos with it. The colors and contrast are gorgeous. I've also used it for portrait shots and the sharpness is almost too sharp and the bokeh is beautiful. Auto focus is a little louder than a Canon USM but definitely not enough to matter. This is one of the best lens purchases I've made.	1
It only seemed to work when you put a flash within one foot of it, directly in front of the "eye". Doesn't work for a studio setting.	0

I bought one of these for my daughter for Christmas.  Of course I didn't try to use it before I gave it to her yet when it came in, I thought I should buy one for me as well.  Now that I have them, neither one of them work at all.  I have used flash slaves for over 40 years without an issue.  I liked the design of these but after trying them with many different flash heads, I could not get either one of them to work once.  I have a lot of CowboyStuidio gear and I love it all but these just don't work.	0
Lens comes in a variety of formats, Canon, Nikon, etc.  Mine was for a Sony A-Mount (SLT-A77v) camera.  The Sony version is a little different as far as switching from manual to AF but its not a big deal.  First I went the way of extension tubes, magnifying diopters, etc.  Those will work but they don't measure up to a dedicated macro.  I spent a lot (a really lot) of time reading reviews and comparing the various options for macro lenses and was down to either this one or the Sony 100mm f/2.8 that was more $$$.  I decided on the Tamron because of the macro pictures I saw primarily on Flickr.  The images were sharp, good contrast, and no apparent aberrations I could tell anyway.The lens didn't disappoint.  The clarity of the macro is pretty amazing.  I've uploaded a couple of pictures to the customer images part including a moth with amazing detail.  Very happy with the lens and would recommend for anyone wanting a great macro capable lens.	1
Will not work with any camera with pre flash!!!! you can get around this by using a diffuser and shooting in manual mode with some cameras. For one shoot they worked and for the other they did not.

This is the worst designed case one could make. the case obstructs the clip from open, which is one of the key feature of the new nano. Do not buy it	0
This is my first Tamron lens, I have been using it for over a year now and to say it in one work "Awesome". I document mushrooms and using this lens to exhibit the finite detail of fungi does a fantastic job. I have also done some portrait work with it and for bust vignette shots where I want the background blurred out it works for me. The 2.8 aperture is excellent for low light settings without bumping up the ISO.	1
When paying quite a lot of money for a lens that shoots at only one focal length, and has the rather un-aggressive maximum aperture of only f/2.5 (not wide enough to get much of a blurred background when taking photos of people), one at least expects the lens to have good optical qualities, right?However, this lens is noticeably less sharp than the Lumix G Vario 14-42mm I kit lens. This lens is noticeably less sharp than the M.Zuiko 14-42mm II kit lens. In both cases, most noticeable at the edges and corners of the frame. So you are paying quite a bit of money to get inferior optical performance to the lens that you already own because it probably came with your camera. (This lens is probably on par with the 14-42mm PZ "pancake" zoom, but that's not a very good lens either.)On top of that, on Olympus cameras this lens produces some of the worst purple fringing I have seen from any lens or camera I have owned.I am at a loss to explain why some people have praised this lens. Is it just bad quality control and I got a bad one? Or are they just not looking carefully at their photos?For approximately the same price as this lens or perhaps just a few extra dollars, you can purchase a Panasonic LX7 camera, and the lens on the LX7 is at least as sharp at the same field of view (28mm on a 35mm film camera), plus as small as this lens may be, the LX7 is still a bit smaller than any m43 camera with this lens on it. And then of course there's the benefit that the LX7 can shoot from 24mm to 90mm and is not limited to just the 28mm field of view.So my advice is that if you think your m43 camera is too big unless you buy this lens, then you are really better off getting a good compact camera instead.	0

After reading so many reviews stating how sharp this lens was I bought it and wanted to like it.I sold my Olympus 17mm in hope of a wider, sharper lens in the Lumix 14mm.I was very displeased with the image quality of the 14mm.The 14mm does focus quicker then the 17mm but in terms of real life image quality the 17mm beats the 14mm easily.Reselling the 14mm to fund the purchase of a 17mm again.If you want 14mm just get the Limix 14-42 lens as it does a better job and is cheaper.	0
I am not a pro. I can only tell you what an amateur feels about this lens. First I have a little bit hard time to mount the lens to my Nikon D7000. My others Nikkor lenses are so easy to snap on. But I think it is not a big deal. The image is sharp. It is as sharp as a prime lens should be. I can even see the dust on my little robot models. The focus speed is well slow. If you don't have a moving subject I think it is ok. Also don't be too close to the subject, sometime the lens will extend significantly during focusing. Even without VR the image is pretty good. Of course if you use tripod then it is not problem. Thank you Tamron for making a Marco for poor man like me.	1
I love the Panansonic GF3 camera but the 14-mm kit lens produces only sub-par photos. To get the most out of the camera, get yourself a 45-150 zoom lens and the 20-mm (1.7f-stop) prime lens (and, of course, others should you want them). I use the 20-mm lens all the time, especially at night, when I carry the camera through cities for night photography.Photos taken with the 14-mm kit lens look as if someone had peed on them; the have a yellowish tinge (certainly not what some enthusiast who gets a Micro 4/3 camera wants or needs). The edges are blurry too. I have decided not to use the 14-mm lens it anymore. The same goes for the 14-42mm kit lens ... get the body and two or three decent lenses. The camera body should make you happy. It is probably too small for some (but great for me because I can slip the camera, with the 20-mm lens attached in my pants pocket) ...	0

I went thru the complicated setup and it just never worked. I've set up many routers over the years but this one was not easy and just didn't work. Sad thing is I waited too long to set it up and the return period was over. So I basically bought a 25 dollar hunk of junk that ended up in the trash. NEVAR AGAIN BELKIN! lol	0
Outstanding Macro lens. I did a lot of research on this lens before purchasing and couldn't find any negatives from the experts. Having it in hand for about a month the images are snappy, even wide open. I now see why prime lenses are held in such high regard. I purposley tried to induce flare with the lens hood on and found it was nearly impossible to  create even pointing the camera just a few degrees from the light source.	1
I got this because I needed a basic router that could handle multiple connections and not break under the strain.  I needed all 4 ports for a desktop (gigabit Ethernet destroys wireless for ping on multiplayer games!), PS3 (same reason), and two networked printers.  I also have three or four devices that connect wirelessly.  This router was easy to set up, had good security options and seemed to work fine for a couple of months.  But I found that YouTube on the wireless connection with a Windows Update running means that my Android smartphone net speed slows to a crawl.  I pay for a 20mbps connection and Speedtest shows that this isn't giving it to me.This router cannot handle multiple connections very well.  Downloading large open-source code packages via P2P networks chokes the pipe to a crawl OR kills it altogether until an unplug and restart.  I have a 1000 square foot apartment with this in one bedroom and when I'm on the other side of the apartment, I don't get full signal.This is a good basic router for a single user who primarily streams YouTube or Netflix to one laptop at a time.  If you are a power user or really need good range, then you need to spend more money on a N600 or N900-level router.  Additionally, since this router does not specify compatibility with IPv6, a more expensive router might be more future proof.I never used the USB port so I can't comment on it.  I never flashed Tomato to it, so I am not sure if that it a good thing or not.  I just know that this router is not really optimized to take advantage of superfast modem speeds.	0

My router died and I figured I'd get a cheap replacement. I guess I got what I paid for. This thing has a mind of its own. Sometimes the signal is great but the connection speed sucks, other times the signal is low and the speed is decent. I can be 10 feet away from it and have it show 50% signal strength. Other times it's at 100% but the speed is slower than dial up. I cannot watch youtube with this router. It's probably too late to return this thing so I'll just review it and hope someone listens to me. My old router worked great until it died, so it's not my provider.	0
I have a Nikon 5100 camera. I was thinking about getting the Nikon version of this but it was over $900!!! I found this as a replacement and so far so good Takes amazing pictures! For me this lens was to just take random closeups of bugs and such. Does the job for a reasonable price.	1
I should have read more of the reviews to realize you have to update the firmware before actually getting this to work.  When I purchase something new, I expect it to actually work out of the box.  Belkin told me they would help me for a fee, even though I had the firmware downloaded.  Because of this, I rather return it and get a working product.  It will be a while before I purchase another Belkin.	0

I don't think I have ever been more frustrated with a router.  This thing can't be any worse, software horrible, constantly drops packets, time to actually give an ip address--horrendous, etc., etc.,  As much as I wanted to keep and use this router since for some reason my network a/v receiver doesn't like my Apple Express or Apple Extreme, this is just a POS.  I have spent no less than 5 hours trying to get this thing to work.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Save yourself frustration and time and spend a bit more for something that a company will put some effort in.  The firmware on this thing hasn't been updated since 2010 (that's what's available on the Belkin website).  That tells you something about their commitment to this product or lack their of.  Amazon should reimburse me for the time wasted on this crap!!!	0
Very nice lens at a great price. Picture quality is superb. My only gripe is the autofocus is slow and a bit noisy. For macro work, this is not a major problem since I use manual focus.	1
Belkin no longer supports this product. We had many problems getting this router to work as a wireless router. It worked OK hard wired but not at all wireless just across the room. Would not recommend it for wireless use. We sent it back.	0

Bought this router to convert an HP printer to wireless printing.  Setup was a little tricky, but got the printer operational.  After five to six weeks of occasional use, the router died.  The unit was operating in a conditioned environment, on top of a filing cabinet. Hope others have better luck with this unit. Looking for a replacement....any suggestions?	0
I purchased the older version despite the new 90mm coming out in April 2013 (needed it for a job).  I've been very pleased with the images coming from the lens.  Macros are sharp and crisp and well detailed.  Focus has been consistent and I've noted very few aberrations such as excessive fringing, etc.  In all, very pleased with this lens.	1
This is a very bad buy. The jack for the audio is very rickety and makes the audio go in and out constantly..............FAIL!	0

I purchased one of these and received it DOA (Dead on Arrival). The replacement one I received worked for a couple days and decided it also needed to retire. I'm a bit upset with the Polaroid Name brand. Should be better.It did have excellent features, but with with the cheapest plastic hot-shoe connections......and they say you can stack them!Not recommended.	0
This lens is a fantastic lens because it takes amazing true 1:1 macro shots and doubles as an awesome portrait head-shot lens. This lens is also a good "street" lens. The low-light aperture of 2.8 is fantastic and the creamy gorgeous bokeh will blow you away. I like that it has a unique manual vs. auto focus ring that pushes and "snaps" back and forth .. took some getting used to but I actually really like this unique method of switching focus modes - no need to hunt for a switch on the side of the lens. Also features TACK SHARP images!Bottom line - if you are trying to get into macro photography and/or are looking for a great portrait "head-shot" lens with awesome bokeh, get this lens!I have some photo examples (link to paste) in the comments section.UPDATE 8/26/2012This is still a great lens and very sharp. The only two points which bug me greatly is that the front expands and contracts for focus (no internal focus) so when you are very close in macro to a subject the lens is almost touching it, and the fact that focus is ungodly slow. At least there is a limit switch, which is needed. For macro, one uses manual focus a lot anyway. I will keep the 5 star for the optics and fantastic pictures, I read reviews and knew what I was getting.	1
Got this LED light for my SLT, to use for film shoots. Well after delivery, didn't open up until a week later. Charged the battery for a half a day, then try to get it to work. To my dismay, nothing happened, nothing showed up that it was powered, just nothing. So, it had to be sent back, for a hundred and seventeen dollars. I got hit with a defected product. If it work for others, that is fine. I guess I wasn't the lucky one.	0

The package arrived three days later than it should.  I bought  light and battery because I had a friend  in Pennsylvania at the time of purchase who would bring them to Jamaica for me. I still have not received my package since I then had to make arrangement to have it shipped offshore to Jamaica due to DBROTH's incompetence which costs me three times as much.  I do not recommend this seller at all !!	0
This lens takes fantastic photos and is way more affordable than the comparable lenses from Canon. I have a lot to learn when it comes to macro photography, but that is what made this lens great. It affords me the opportunity to have a very high quality lens at a price I could justify at my skill level. I will be able to continue to grow and learn and this lens will not limit me at all.The clarity is superbBokeh is smooth and easily obtained.fast aperture.The only thing I can think of that could be better would be the auto focus. It can be slow, but once you are close with your focus the auto focus is fast. Only when going from very different focal distances does it start to search a little and take some time.Overall I would recommend this lens to any photographer at most skill levels. Its great for macro, portraits, and everything in between.	1
Like Nick P. pointed out in his review, the batteries that come with this product aren't the greatest. I find that they drain out if you leave them attached to the back of the light when stored away for two or more days. So be sure to remove the batteries when not in use.We fully charged both batteries the night before a job in case we needed to use the light. Of course, we did end up using the light since we had to interview a person on location. Less than 3 minutes into the interview, the batteries completely died on us.I contacted Polaroid, since my return policy was past the 30-days that Amazon allows for a full refund, and they pretty much told me that I was SOL.If you're going to purchase this light, I highly suggest getting the genuine Sony batteries instead of using these ridiculous knock-offs.	0

Only when going from very different focal distances does it start to search a little and take some time.Overall I would recommend this lens to any photographer at most skill levels. Its great for macro, portraits, and everything in between.	1
The light did not work at all. Unfortunately, this us not the sellers problem, I'm sure they didn't make it. Anyway, it was defective and had to be returned	0
i was looking for a portable lightweight player to watch at work and after looking at other lesser known brands i decided to go for the panasonic.its full of features plays all the formats very attractive lightweight incredible picture.the best feature this player has is the innovative viewing styles which accomodates whichever position your sitting.am so happy with my player i called it my baby.but beleive me its not a toy!!go and buy it!!	1
Let me preface this review by reminding myself that I only paid $79.99 for it, and yes it's true; you get what you pay for.Okay, now that all that's out of the way, I'm stuck feeling some regret in buying two of these. I'm seriously considering returning them in fact, which is something I rarely (if ever) actually do.The light output and quality are both okay, no less and certainly no more than what I would've expected. I guess the problem is in the build quality. These feel to me like they came out of a kids toy set.The barn doors and dimmer are great additions to this light, but the dimmer is very suspect. It seems to work more like a stepper than a dimmer. Turning the dial, even in a very controlled slow motion, results in the light jumping in very noticeable steps. There's no way you could ever use this light for any sort of in-camera lighting tricks.This is definitely a "Buyer-Beware" item, especially if you have any intentions of trying to use this light in any sort of a professional setting.* UPDATE as of 4/27/2011 *So I decided to return both of these. Amazon, of course, was great about accepting them and refunding the full purchase price for both. Thanks Amazon, your fantastic Customer Service is what keeps me coming back for more.	0

This IR light works about to 18 inches.  Either the light will not charge fully or the output is that low.  I am totally unhappy with this product.  It is a waste of money and I feel scammed.  DO NOT BUY!	0
I just purchased this unit after owning a 5" Panasonic DVD player. The chief differences between this unit and similar units of others brands are:(1) The picture is much brighter and sharper(2) The simulated surround sound using headphones (I use theKoss Porta Pros) is much louder and the sound is more spacious and open(3) This unit plays "marginal" DVD's with make other units skip(4) The screen tilts to virtually any position making its use in planes or other tight spaces more flexible(5) It is much more solidly built than its competitors(6) It immediately recognizes the DVD that has been placed in the unit and adjusts the size of the picture automatically(7) There is less wasted space around the 7" screen making the unit smaller and lighter..it is barely larger than the actual size of the screen.(8) It's battery is virtually internal, simply snapping onto a recessed area in the bottom of the unit. It appears to be "built directly into the unit"(9) It's remote control is "full size" Although it occupies little space in my bag, it is much more user friendly than the small remotes that come with other units.(10) It's price is only about $50 more than the competition, and given all of the above, it is well worth the difference, especially considering the "rebate package" which includes a case and a DC adaptor.I bought mine at B&H; Photo...The shipping charge is only about $10, and, although the delivery promises 3-5 days, I received mine the very next day (in CT).The price was also as low as any out there.	1
I looked around specifically for an LED video light that would mount on the Sony Alpha 57 DSLR camera. As Sony buyers know, Sony in their infinite wisdom has chosen to be the only company NOT to use the standard shoe mount that every other camera maker in the world uses, so it requires some serious hunting to find lights that will fit without needing cumbersome adapters.I was completely disappointed to discover this Polaroid unit, while clearly advertising all the Sony Alpha models it fits, mine included, is actually nothing more than the same old standard mount. It doesn't fit the Alpha series, and it doesn't even come with an adapter to do so. I went back to be sure I ordered the right unit. When I clicked on the link where I placed the order, it comes up prominently displaying that it's made for the Alpha series, listing over a dozen Sony models it fits. But when I click the link of the product actually shipped, there's no mention of the Alpha series whatsoever.This is an excellent light for any other camera or camcorder besides the Sony Alpha series. It's bright, it has variable intensity and also variable white balance, which is rare for any video light. Unfortunately, the battery charger that came with it has a defective plug that will not make contact with the electrical outlet unless you press it hard against the wall and stand there doing that for several hours. The included battery, being the same size and voltage as a Sony NPF550 of NPF570, will not accept a charge in the Sony charger. But the video light does work using those Sony batteries.While the light itself is actually a pretty good unit when used with anything but a Sony, the power accessories are useless Chinese garbage. This makes the entire product completely useless to anyone who doesn't already own the compatible NPF series Sony batteries and chargers.UPDATE:A second unit was sent to replace the first one. It, too, does not fit the Sony Alpha series, but at least the charger and battery on this second unit are good.	0

Can't see where it lights anything up at all, let alone the distance they recommend, sure not worth the money at all.	0
The DVD-LS50 and DVD-LS55 are essentially the exact same DVD players, save the much larger / heavier and longer lasting battery in the LS55; and the LS55 has a pretty useless FM transmitter to listen through an FM radio (through your car speakers without an audio jack). The chassis is exactly the same.This portable DVD player is my best friend. It has travelled with me for the past 5 years, well over 300,000 miles worth of plane trips (last year it was on about 50 short round trips) and hotels all over the world. That funky looking hinge looks like a crazy, useless idea - au contraire, it is well near brilliant. Its super easy to adjust the viewing angle and position to the perfect spot. Aside from a recent tear down and cleaning, this DVD player has not let me down. If you have landed on this review, it is probably because you are looking at the portable DVD player from a used source. This is a darn good DVD player.The small bad thing I had to do recently. Discs would sometimes skip after playing for a while. As with almost all DVD players there is a worm drive for the laser, and it is pretty much totally exposed to the elements - hair, dust, dirt...all kinds of things. No matter how well you take care of this, the worm drive is going to get gunked up. It's a pretty simple matter to remove all the screws from the back, pull off the back, undo one ribbon cable connector (the flip down trap type), take a cotton swab or small screwdriver and remove all the gunk. A light spray of a compatible lubricant, I used 3M's silicone spray, and the machine was back in business. There are pictures of the teardown available, just use your favorite search engine.This DVD player has probably seen over a 1,000 DVD's in its lifetime. As it's gotten older, dual layer DVD+R's are a bit random if they will play. I've never had a problem with single layer DVD's. Commercial discs play flawlessly. In an airplane, if you set the player on a tray table, after about an hour the machine gets pretty warm and some discs will skip. The solution is to just hold the player in your hands, or don't put on a full cover label on the DVD.Quality of this player - images are good. I've always had the color dialed all the way down to -5, and even there the saturation is a bit intense for my taste. Over the long haul, I've had to set brightness a bit higher. I used to watch at 0 in a normally lit room, and -3 or -5 in a darkened plane. Now I'm finding 0 for the dark plane, 2 or 3 for the room, and 5 in any kind of daylight. The screen is still very visible. Two headphone jacks, outstanding, I share a movie occasionally with my wife. I've never used the optical out. But line out audio and composite video with the included cable work just great in the new hotel room video television connectors. No this does not have component out available at all. The build is solid. That hinge has lasted a great long time. I can always adjust it to get a good quality image.Video does require a straight on view; the viewing angle is very narrow. Speaker sound - what do you expect? They are dinky speakers - great for in a quiet room and one person. Headphones are the way to go for sound on this machine.The player is rugged. In all these miles and all these discs, there are only three tiny chips in the black paint, not a wear mark or scratch anywhere else. The battery has held up well. I can easily watch two full movies on a single charge. Yes its 5 years old, so the battery doesn't have the capacity it once did. Replacement batteries are readily available, but sadly they are almost the price of a whole new player. I'm considering a DVD-LS83 with a larger screen, less battery life, and much heavier. But it is a whole lot less money than I paid for the LS-55 brand new (read way over 500 dollars).This is a really great portable DVD player. It has served me extremely well.	1
I would not waste the money with this unit unless you're an ipod user.I have a Zune MP3 player and an Android phone and neither work with this unit through the USB. Bluetooth with the Android phone only works for calls which is nice, but what's the use of bluetooth if you can't transmit music through wireless bluetooth? Just seems like Pioneer really dropped the ball on this unit.While I said I wouldn't buy this unit unless you were an Ipod user, I mean Ipod specifically. My girlfriend plugged her Iphone in through USB and got the same error 19 that I got with my Zune.really a poor unit in my opinion and I know there are far better out there for the same price.	0

While I could say a some good things about the HDS100 but I just wasted an entire day messing with a product that mis-stated what it can do, so I won't... This does not support surround sound (5.1 Audio) so if your intent is to use this with your home theater/surround sound then this is not the right product, it only supports 2 channel audio.The main reason I bought it was to connect a Home Theater PC (HTPC)to a home theater surround sound receiver, the idea is to move the HTPC out of the living room where the home theater is. So the two main features for me was HD Video (full 1080p) and at 5.1 surround sound. One is no good without the other in this setting.This is what Peerless claims here on Amazon:"Stream Surround Sound AudioThe HD Flow doesn't just stream video, it also streams surround sound audio. It supports 5.1 channel digital audio and DTS for a seamless synchronization of picture and sound, giving you a complete viewing experience."Hard to be a lot clearer than the above claim, too bad it is not accurate/true. I painstakingly found that you only get 2-Ch audio, no matter what you do. (The specs in the manual say - ""Digital Audio IN/OUT Interface - DTS 5.1 Ch., AC3 5.1 Ch."This is just not accurate, it does not support DTS or AC3 5.1 Audio from any source.To give it one, no doubt about it chance, I hooked my Blu-Ray player directly to the HDS100 Transmitter, and a 5.1 HDTV to the HDS100 Receiver, so everything was off-the-shelf consumer products and full HD/Surround devices, it still did not work.I then went back to the HTPC and looked at the Sound Configuration in Win7, it showed the HDS100 transmitter "advertises" itself as only capable of analog and digital (PCM) stereo. HDMI connected devices tell each other what they can do and adjust accordingly, so with the HDS100 reporting itself as 2 channel audio, nothing will talk to it in 5.1 audio.For the price this is really a basic feature that should be supported, even if I could live with stereo I would still be returning it, there are a lot lower priced units that will do HDMI and 2 channel sound, this is nearly twice the price of the competitors!I actually read the manual before I bought it, that makes this a little more disappointing, not to mention the hassle of returning it and getting another unit.Look for my review of the Brite-View if you are interested in sending HD video and true surround audio, I am going to give the Brite-View AirHD (about 1/2 the price of this) a shot, it also says it supports surround sound, I hope they actually do.	0
This Panasonic 7" portable DVD player is more expensive than no-name brands like Mintek or Initial, but it's also much better quality.  The LCD screen is brighter and clearer (although you might want to turn down the brightness to conserve battery), the build quality is excellent (Mintek and Initial players often feel very cheap and flimsy), and the battery is smaller and lasts longer.  The Panasonic also plays a lot of different formats, and the small speakers give pretty good sound for their size.  Seriously, if you are gonna use a portable DVD player a lot, get this high-quality model instead of trying to save a few bucks on a low-quality brand.	1
I bought the HD Flow system because I have an HDTV I want to mount in my kitchen, which is at the far end of the second floor of of my three story house.  I received it along with the rest of my install equipment (mount, plugs, wires etc.) from amazon, but the entire install depended on the HD Flow being able to transmit an acceptable signal through my 1st-2nd floor and through a set of two walls to the kitchen TV.  As i write this i realize the feat I am asking for a wireless signal to do, but I was sold by their video that claims 131 feet through floors and walls.  But my transmitter (tX) and receiver (rX) would only be 60 feet apart...that should work right?My order arrived, install is incredibly easy, 4 cables if you're using HDMI.  The "HD Flow" logo appeared on my TV, but nothing more; info button revealed the tX was not sending data to the rX.  I checked the source (Cable TV box), it was fine and the TV was on and set to the correct inputs.  I then decided to move the tX and rX right next to each other to see if they were the issue.  Sure enough after trying multiple input types, resets, and factor default resets I determined they were faulty and returned them to Amazon (who handled the exchange very well I should say).I received an exchange the next day and went through the motions of getting things setup.  This time when the tX and rX were right next to each other, they were talking and transmitting great picture and great sound.  Nice!  However, when I moved the rX and tX into the places where they would be post-install, the connection was not so easy.  They would blink continuously and say tX was not sending data.  This happened until I did a factory reset on both.  Eventually I got the picture and sound to display, alas! they connected.  Unfortunately it was extremely blotchy at best and the sound was nothing but stutters and only got worse if anyone was in the kitchen.  Obviously I was asking far to much of this wifi signal...I won't give it a 1-star rating because it DOES work, but I can't give more than a 2-star rating because it did not perform as advertised.  Hopefully others have better luck with it than I did.	0

Had this charger for about a week then one of the prongs got stuck in plug, removed it and attempted to fix It, tried it one more time with the same results. RETURNED!	0
HOLY Sh** this thing is AWeSOME...... The sound in this unit is incredible it supports DTS.. which is AWeSOME,, The Picture is Unbelieble... and the best part is that you can change the screen angle.. the price is Excellent ,, thank you Amazon for having this product available... I don't work for AMAZON... trust me on that one... if you are looking for a excellent Dvd player look no further... really you won't be disapointed.. why save $1.00 for something that looks ok.. spend the extra $1.00 and have an Excellent product.. plays everything , DVD+ , DVD-R, extc..... it's also really light.. I love it.. one thing I didn't like is the price for the extra battery.. but hey its worth it..	1
Delivery was propmt. It was packaged in a plain transparent plastic wrapper. It was not as what I expected since this is a Targus brand. I was expecting a more decent packaging specially for the price I paid. What's more disappointing is when I opened the item I tried the Ipad cable first. I connected it to my Ipad 2 and to my laptop. My Ipad was not detected. So tried it with supplied power adapator and still it did not charge. I got my spare Ipad cable and tried it on the charger, the momment I plugged it in charging immediately started. Problem isolated I got a defective cable. I did tried it again for several times but to no avail. For me it's not worth the price I paid for. My expectation for this brand Targus is quite high and was not met.	0

LATEST UPDATE: Nice to see Amazon does pay attention. For such a big corporation, they actually still listen to what you have to say.I complained that they are not sending out the right targus charger pictured. I have gotten the wrong once twice. So they have pulled it temporarily, hence you will see third party sellers have this only for now.Well done Amazon! Let's get some quality control back!UPDATE:  Wow, this is a first, Amazon getting an order wrong twice!!! Both times now I have not gotten the one pictured that I ordered the first time.  I suspect Targus has stopped making the charger pictured and are now just sending out a generic wall charger.This is really funny. I am going to take a pic of it so folks can see what you will really get. What is happening to Amazon's quality control!!! For shame guys!This is my second time ordering this charger, the first time, I received the one pictured, the second time, I got a different charger.  The cord on the one I got is shorter, and it is more of a plug in wall traveling charger, and gets very very hot quickly!!! There is also no light indicator. I did not experience that with the one pictured.  I needed an Ipad charger quickly that I knew was reliable, so I ordered this one again because the other one got lost.If my daughter did not use the pad so much, I would send this one back ASAP and get a refund, but I plan to let Amazon know either way.Be sure to let amazon know ahead of time if you are ordering this one, that you are getting the one pictured!!!If anyone else has experienced this, please let me know!!	0
I frequently take the 4 hour bus ride between New York and Boston and was growing tired of lugging my 7lb laptop to watch DVDs. I was also concerned about this $2000 work computer getting lost/stolen. So although it was tough to justify the cost because I already had something that was 'free' and had a 15" screen, I was ready to buy a portable.When I first shopped a year ago, I really liked the look and feel of the Toshiba P-1200. But online reviews citing battery problems scared me away. And a guy in work had it happen to him. It just died. I was hoping they fixed it with the P-1400, but I still saw a few users saying they had battery issues. Meanwhile, the reviews for the Panasonic were glowing. Here were the pros and cons between the two:- Toshiba $70 less vs. Panasonic- Toshiba 3-3 1/2 hr battery life vs. 2-2 1/2 hr for Panasonic- Toshiba credit card remote vs. big remote on Panansonic- Toshiba comes with car charger, but Panasonic has charger AND case via rebate- Toshiba 3.25 lbs vs. 1.75 lbs for PanasonicSo it came down to this. Should I pay more money for a smaller, lighter product that had better reviews, even though the battery life might be an issue. So I went to see them in person.The result? No contest. The Panasonic is very small and very light. Much easier to toss in my carry-on messenger bag. And the screen is bright and clear. The coolest thing is how the screen can be contorted into so many angles, which is very helpful when the person in front of you reclines their seat halfway into your lap. Additionally, the remote is a non factor for me. I leave it at home. Why? The Panasonic has a very slick shuttle dial that lets you FF and REW through the DVD at different speeds.In summary, I've used it on one bus ride and one flight so far and it's been great. While I don't want to completely diss Toshiba (I just bought an awesome 30" Toshiba HDTV), for my money the Panasonic has been the right choice.	1
When  it works, it is great, but...I am totally frustrated with Dell and this product at this point.  The product would not accept a charge.  After three weeks of bumbling and fumbling and hours on the phone with India, they finally agreed to take it in for repair.  Problem is, the repair facility is in Mexico in a facility run by another company, Flextronics..  Bottom line is that the best estimate I have is a total of 5-6 weeks for the tablet being out of commission before possibly being returned from the repair facility.  Thus far, they have been unresponsive on my request for a new unit.  It has been a real horror story of customer service.  They wanted me to arrange conference calls between myself, Fedex, and India because they did not prepare the proper paperwork for shipment overseas.  They even wanted me to prepare the commercial invoice to send it to Mexico.  They were also too cheap to pay the extra $15 to pick up the product on a Saturday.The instructions said to wipe the unit clean of any "sensitive" data, but this is impossible because the unit will not take a charge.  As instructed, I have removed the SD card and the SIM card before returning the product, but I am still concerned about the fact that there could be sensitive data on this unit, a unit destined for Mexico.Meanwhile, the monthly data contract for T-Mobile continues, me paying their bills without me having a product for at least a month.If you do buy this product, I would consider an extended warranty (3rd party as I don't recommend Dell at this point).  If you are beyond the warranty and still have a monthly obligation with T-Mobile, you could still be paying their bills monthly without a working product.  If you do have a problem with this product, it will be a nightmare.If Dell thinks this is a better way to do business, I suggest they think again.	0

Received the DS7 yesterday in perfect shape, spent the last 2 days playing with it trying to get everything working. So far the battery lasts about 3 hours, the SD card reader works about 40% of the time, and the unit resets when ever it get loaded down. I will be doing a hard reset today to see if during setup I messed up a setting but if it still has issues then back to Amazon it will go as a defective product. Update coming.2.28.11 Update:Finally found a SD card that works, now the issues about very weak battery life - come on 2 to 3 hours on WIFI and a very weak screen???? Turned it on today and I can see a dead pixel. I am really sad about returning this unit, went to BB and played with the Galaxy. The Dell is so much better looking and almost twice as fast plus it can be upgraded to 3.0. I may wait a few weeks and see if they come out with a improved model.	0
After doing some searching online I found the following solution on a message forum:Open up the bottom cover by taking out the screws - 10 or so. This will reveal the lens and motor module. Flip over the model and you should see the gear and shaft for the lens. Move the gear so that the lens move towards the center. Click the covers back into place , reconnect the battery and try. There were many responses that said it was easy and the unit works perfectly.Another person said to do the following:Error codes could be solved by turning on your device, taking out any disk, closing the tray and pushing the back skip, pause, and play buttons at the same time. Hold for about 4 seconds and the screen will go blank then "initializing" will appear and your player will read your disks again.I want to buy this unit but I'm hesitant.  I'd love to hear if this works.  Good luck	1
If Skype is important to you (and it was to me when I bought this), DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL! The product description states: "1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for video chats (fixed focus) for face-to-face chats on popular services such as Qik or Skype" which led me to believe that the front camera would work on Skype. It does not. Skype for Android requires 2.3 OS at least, so the rear camera works but not the front one on this model. BFDeal. And, because this model is locked, you cannot upgrade the OS at this time.I spent a lot of time trying to work this out to no avail.Other things to say about this model: the charger cord is way too short, and because it is proprietary, it is difficult to deal with. Model does not keep a charge for even a day, and I am not watching movies or playing games. The model freezes frequently and has to be hard-reset at least once a day. Do not buy this if you are depending in it for anything important.Sigh. What a disappointment.	0

Let me start off by saying that I purchased this because my Galaxy tablet was stolen and I had to have a replacement and T-Mobile was out of the Galaxy Tablet at the time.  So then and only then did I purchase the Dell Streak 7.  FIrst off, T-Mobile sent me a prepaid card that had to be reactivated; Secondly, the daggone adapter was defective and would not charge after the initial charge.  After T-Mobile found me a store in Houston, no less, that had a car charger, they made arrangements with Dell to send me a new adapter, on July 27, 2011.  It is now August 5 and I still have not received it so I had to purchase an outlet that works with car chargers which will also drain your device AFTER it reaches 100% if you do not remove it from the charger. Thirdly, once you do get it charged to 100%, you can probably read half of a book (I purchased it basically as an e-reader, not for all the other bells and wistles)before the battery drains back down to 35%. So needless to say this product is useless.And I took it to Florida with me for a conference right after purchasing it and I was unable to utilize it because the resort where I stayed had no free wi-fi (imagine that) and was made of concrete and could neither get a signal for cell phones either so in all, this was a useless device to me so I called T-Mobile to utilize my 14-day buyer's remorse to get rid of this gizmo.  Not for just the fact that I could not acces the 3G or wi-fi components of this useless piece of crap, but because the adapter was useless and even the one time I was able to read a book during the most boring parts of the conference I attended, it emitted a loud beep during one of the speaker's speeches indicating low battery drawing attention to me.	0

I have not been able to successfully build a Windows 7 x64 PC with this motherboard. I've been building PCs for 20 years and even with that experience I am unable to complete the build and get Windows successfully installed.First, this motherboard is somehow not compatible with the DC-DC power board in my mini PC case. The motherboard can be powered by other power supplies and the power supply can power other motherboards but the two are incompatible. Since I also sell these mini PC cases it's turned into a customer support nightmare having to exchange power boards for customers. The ASRock Z68M-ITX and A75M-ITX work (among motherboards from all different brands) but the H67M-ITX does not. I've never come across a power board/motherboard incompatibility before. This I was able to at least workaround with a different DC-DC power board or in my own build, a picoPSU. I have no idea which is the issue, the motherboard or the power supply, but it takes the two together to cause the issue. The symptom is that the system turns on for about 1 second and then turns itself right back off.Second, and most importantly since I can find no workaround, the graphics drivers included on the CD crash Windows 7 on startup and the system has to be recovered. I tried all three graphics drivers on the CD, the latest from the ASRock site and the latest from Intel. I updated the BIOS as well. All attempts give the same result: BSOD on startup just after "Starting Windows" and then it's off to system recovery. The BSOD says "BadDriver". I also tried HDMI and DVI-D since my research had shown some issue with BSODs and HDMI with Intel drivers but it was to no avail. The cabling didn't matter. Strangely, Windows 8 CP works right out of the box. Windows 8 CP however isn't ready for production so I need Windows 7 on my PC. I don't have this issue on a different board with the same CPU, RAM and SSD.I see a lot of glowing reviews here so these incompatibilities seems very hit-or-miss. I cannot speculate why.Besides these issues, my other issue has been the layout of the motherboard. The front panel connections are at the back of the board. This requires the front panel connections to be stretched across the board if they reach at all. Of all the things that should to be at the front of the board, it should be the front panel connectors. I have never seen a motherboard with them at the back.Thanks to Amazon's wonderful return policy I can happily exchange it for a different motherboard.[Update 18-May-2012]I received theGigabyte GA-H61N-USB3 motherboardtoday and put it together with the same RAM, CPU, SSD and power supply. Windows 7 x64 and all the drivers that came with the Gigabyte driver CD installed without issue, including the graphics driver. No BSODs / operating system corruption / bad driver issues.	0

Ended up settling for this one after problems with 3 others from local store. Figured it would be alright since Westinghouse used to be a good quality brand. First thing the clock was a spazz. Set the date & time, turn it off and back on and not only would the time be wrong but the date would change. Every time I turned it on the date would be anywhere from a couple weeks off to several years ahead or behind. I figured Oh well, I have plenty of other clocks and it doesn't matter if it has one or not since the picture was good. And it did have a great picture! Just before I bought this one a friend had got a 42" Vizio and tried talking me into getting one. But comparing his Vizio to this Westinghouse, this one had a far better picture. His Vizio was like watching TV through a screen door compared to this Westinghouse. I was pretty happy with it. It could have a couple more HDMI plugins on it and the speakers could be a little better. And for the price it should have WiFi built into it. But it wasn't too bad of a TV. Until a couple days ago.The drain for my kitchen sink got hopelessly clogged the other day and I was working on that while the TV was on. Then I noticed the sound quit. Turned around and looked at it and it was turned off. I thought. Now the thing wont turn on. I unplugged the power converter from the surge-protector power strip and plugged it in a different wall outlet. Still wouldn't turn on. Took the power converter out to my workshop and tested it with my electrical tester and it was putting out the voltage that the sticker on it says its supposed to put out. So there's nothing wrong with the power converter. I've emailed Westinghouse customer service, 3 days ago. I got a confirmation email from them that they received my email but haven't had any other contact from them. So tomorrow I'll start the game of Phone Tag with the automated phone system and see if I can talk to an actual person and find out if this thing has a reset button somewhere or a little fuse somewhere that can be replaced. Usually that's all is need when something like this just shuts off and wont turn on. Unfortunately I cant find the extended warranty I think I bought for it. By my receipt its 6 months past its Westinghouse warranty. Any which way I look at it I'm screwed out of $584 bucks I paid for it. 18 months of use just ain't worth that much. That comes out to just over $32 a month to have it. I ain't going to say what the cable company is screwing me for. But for $32 a month I may as well of had one of the rent to own things. Then it wouldn't cost me anything to replace it.So, if you already have one of these, good luck. Maybe you will have one that will last for years. I just wish I could have read some of these before I settled for this one because it sure didn't turn out to be worth what I paid for it. Specially since I had saved up my money for 2 years to buy the stupid thing. Being on SS disability what I paid for it is over half of months income for me.	0
I bought my LS50 a few months ago and all the reviews I read were excellent. Then all these horror stories about the dreaded HO3 code coming up making the player inoperable surfaced in the reviews. If I had waited until now to purchase this unit I wouldnt have based on the number of these recent reviews.I purchased my unit in March. I can only hope the manufacturer has cleared up the problems that others were having, but I m not holding my breath. I love the LS50..its just the right size, it sounds great and I take it everywhere...BUT..everytime I play it I wonder if I will be hit with the dreaded HO3. I did take out the two year warranty plan when I purchased it, so I assume Panasonic will replace it if this happens.Panasonic is such a well known quality name. Why does that HO3 come up and for no apparent reason? This would have been a five star review, but I shouldn t have to worry about the player ceasing to operate everytime I use it. Wonder If I was better off going with Initial or Toshiba,etc? I figure I'd pay a little more for the Panaonic name, but why is this HO3 thing happening to so many people?	1
Had this big screen tv for two months.  Powered off and would not start up again.  The power supply was extremely hot and it is apparent that this either failed or the tv did something to make the power supply fail.  If you're looking for something that is a mediocre tv at best, and expect a functional operating life of little more than a D-cell battery, this is the tv for you.  Otherwise, spend a little more and get something that has a name brand that carries today's expected level of quality, not something that relies on a product brand name that was made in years of the great depression.	0

Dont buy this piece of junk or any other Westinghouse product! Ill keep it short since this alreay has plenty of bad reviews that describe the same problem.The TV lasted 2 years. This past week it just turned off while I was watching it. I tested the outlets and the power supply and everything was working. It was out of warranty so I didn't even bother to call Best buy. I took it to an electronics repair shop and they indicated the LED back light panel died. It was not worth the cost of getting a new one. The guy was going to attempt to repair it, but told me not to get my hopes up.	0
I bought this after noticing that the DVD player rental chain  in many airports uses Panasonics exclusively, which to me says something about durability.  Comparing this unit with Audiovox, Mintek and Magnavox, it is obviously much more solid.  The great thing, though, is that for the same screen size, the unit is slimmer and lighter.  The swivel screen makes it very easy to hang on the back of the driver's seat in the car for kids to watch, since it folds flat and won't protrude from the seat back.  Others have noted short battery life.  I took it on a plane trip from Alaska to Arizona and watched all of the extended version of The Two Towers (over 3.5 hours) and didn't run out of battery.  I turned the brightness all the way down, but the picture was still very clear and easy to see in a darkened airplane.  The great thing is that the battery is much smaller and lighter than other DVD players I've seen, and doesn't really add to the size or weight of the unit.  This thing is great for viewing my CR-RWs with lots of family photos on them, as well as listening to MP3s or WMAs (it even recognizes playlists, although I haven't tried this out yet).  The controls on the player allow you to easily operate it without the remote, except for specialized functions.  With the free case and airplane/car power adapter offer through Amazon (I'm still waiting for mine), and Amazon's great price, you just can't lose with this.  The only thing the Mintek has that this doesn't is A/V input, but if you don't need to play video games on it, it's not a problem.  Don't waste your money on a slightly cheaper unit that doesn't even compare with this.  You'll be glad you spent a little more.	1
I bought a TV on the thanks giving day of 2011. At that time, to configure and to start watching they had this process of customers calling a 1800 number and register the TV with the serial number. Now the TV is showing dark spots on the left bottom side. When I called them up they said it is still under warranty and stuff. I also gave them the Serial number, ID (which I had to give by the time i bought to configure the TV), proof of purchase as my credit card statement. Now they are saying it cannot be considered as i have to have the receipt which i lost. It is very disappointing that I put in this kind of money and getting bashed like this. PFA the pictures and decide whether you want to buy the TV.	0

I had high expectations for a bag which cost over $60.  The bag is smaller than the dimensions given in the ad. I can barely fit my camera, a lens or two in the bag without it over flowing.  This is not made for anything other than one camera, if that.  Maybe a point and shoot?It's laughable crap like this, which leads to new products, so I guess there are some plus'.  I wish the designers would have thought to grab a couple cameras and see if they actually fit in the bag.The quality of the bag is top-notch.  But unfortunately, it's just not applicable in the real world. It's a real shame.	0

This works great to hid computer, telephone etc cables at out desks.  Bundles up all tohse messy wires into a neat clean 1 inch cable tube.	1
item came damaged was hoping to use these for my kids bought 3 of them but I feel they were not a good deal since they did come damage and im unable to send them back they will cost more to send back then what I paid and the company is only offering a 30% refund for them so I will eat the cost and not shop with them ever again	0

That is a bad thing because of the front camera. When you try to put the Xoom in a standing up position the tablet slides down, which blocks the camera's view, so, a video chat is almost impossible.	0
I needed some striated tubing material for a pilot helmet I was creating for a costume and this seemed to fit the bill, so I gave it a shot. The packaging this came in was fairly large in order to contain a 10 foot coil of tubing. The quality of the plastic is rough and rather cheap, but it works perfectly. It has already been slitted open for easy insertion of wires, etc. and 10 feet is easily more than enough for me to finish the project. I will probably use the rest of the tubing to organize my jungle of wires running under my desk. Overall, this item meets my expections.	1
The case is quite average. The magnetic flap works well is the only real positive, it seems that the holes for accessories and access were not particularly well thought out as the micro SD card slot is inaccessable, also the thin strip sometimes blocked the front camera. Also you must leave the case open to charge the xoom (I cut a small hole in mine to allow it to close)	0

I tried iTrip and promptly returned it. The device was cumbersome and it sounded crappy. That was over a year ago. Then recently about two months ago, I decided to reinvestigate FM transmitters for my pod. I stumbled upon a really thin review for PodFreq and purchased it at a local store for $100. I shunned the price, but I liked the all-in-one design without the iTrip playlist fiasco. In addition, I was going on a long trip and wanted an FM tranmitter ASAP.After I tried it, I fell in love with it. I thought I would hate it and end up returning it but it worked easily, and very well. I love the fact that I don't have to fuss with the volume of the pod if a song is too soft or loud since it's handled through the radio. I love the easy digital tuner on the bottom (I hated with a passion iTrip's frequency playlist). I love the fact that it puts out a stronger and clearer signal than the other FM transmitters. And, the firewire ports help too!The device is easy to use, much clearer than iTrip and works really well. I find myself using my pod even more with PodFreq. The attenea on the back is kinda weird, but the sound it transmits is well worth it. I've never raved about products I buy by posting comments, but I'm thrilled with it. At $100 it was a lot, but in my opinion well worth it. I now don't have to fuss, try, and return other FM transmitters because of some lousy reason or another. I saved a lot of time, money, and energy by purchasing the PodFreq. I highly recommend it.Funny how stores such as the Apple Store, Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA, etc. don't carry this item.Oh, since the device has a firewire port, you can sync your pod using a 6-6 pin fireware cable without taking your pod out of PodFreq.	1

This is a great device and certainly a lot cheaper than the automotive adapter kits at $300! In crowded radio markets (LA, SF) you should find frequencies that don't have other stations to close to minimize interference. Highly recommended.	1
I purchased this and installed on my Sony C3 camera. As long as you don't touch or bump it the productwill stay on the camera. A slight touch and it comes off camera. Also comes off when put in camerabag. This is a total waist of money, not worth the effort of putting it on every time it comes off camera.If I could rate this a zero I would as I spent good money for it and now it sets in a drawer collecting dust.	0

I have a hard screen protector on my Sony 5N which prevents this from fitting properly.  So I either give up the screen protector or use this hood.  I'll stick with the screen protector.  I think the manufacturer could modify their design to work with the screen protector if they choose to do so.	0
I had an Itrip. I didn't like the itrip playlist of frequencies. I found locking on a frequency in that playlist awkward. I found reception often to be marginal. The Podfreq frequency set up is easy, an up and down button for frequency adjust with a direct readout. Stability and reception seemed much improved over the Itrip. Very satisfied with the unit.	1
I owned one of these before buying this one here on Amazon, and with the same results... They are extremely cheaply made... And will break on you, Eventually. The hinges are made of thin, cheap plastic and crack with the slightest pressure. Pressure that you have to apply when opening and closing this shade.I wish somebody would make a metal version of this shade, as when it works it is very functional, especially on bright, sunny days. Unfortunately, just using this device as specified by the manufacturer... You will eventually break it and have to buy one after another, in order to enjoy the functionality that this unit provides.It's a shame, because It really works, for the short time that it functions.	0

I had been looking for an FM transmitter for my iPod for awhile. Had checked out the iTrip and others, but they just didn't seem all that reliable or robust. I found out about the Podfreq from a very favorable mention in MacWorld Magazine, the Feb 05 issue, I think.I checked around for suppliers and found the best price at Amazon. Got it about a week ago.It does exactly what I wanted to do, and a bit more besides. I really like being able to tune in the radio station from the Podfreq base instead of from my iPod. I have a digital radio in my car so it's very easy to match frequencies. It does not seem to pull much power from the iPod, and it does come with a car charger. It also comes with foam pads that enable you to custom fit your iPod to the Podfreq. The latch mechanism holds the iPod quite efficiently.There is also a very solid extendable antenna that works quite well. I have had very clear reception in the city. And if I hear any static over the radio I just extend the antenna and it goes away.Previously I had run the iPod through my car system by means of a tape. The sound is much better now, and I don't have to have that extra wire, so the iPod is much easier to use. And the excellent sound quality of the iPod comes out through using the Podfreq, as it never did with the tape.Haven't tried it out on the road yet, so I don't know how much of a pain it might be to change stations. I suspect not much, but I don't have experience of that.The whole thing seems quite well-built and designed. With respectful handling (it is, after all, mostly plastic) I think it will last quite awhile. The latch holds the iPod very well and the foam pads keep it from rattling. The buttons for power and changing the radio station are big enough to handle easily, and the display is large and easy to read, even for 50-year-old eyes. The antenna attachment on the back seems firm, and the antenna seems the same as you'd find on portable radios--in other words, not flimsy. The car charger is pretty compact and has a coiled cord which I prefer to a straight cord.I have two small concerns: the part that rotates out from the base so that you can stand the Podfreq up is plastic and looks delicate, so I don't think I'll be using it in the car. Also, I will be sticking some velcro on the back of the unit so that the whole thing doesn't slip off the car seat when I come to a stop. But that's easy to do.The Podfreq does the same thing inside my car as my other can't-do-without accessory, InMotion speakers, does inside my house. I'm very glad I got it, and it has resulted in my using my iPod much more in my car because it's easier to use and sounds a whole lot better.	1
There is some confusion about these speakers, do they get their audio via USB or just their power via USB?  The answer is that these speakers get their power via a USB but do not receive their audio via a USB. The speakers must be plugged in via your audio out or headphone jack in order to receive audio. More importantly the sound quality produced by the speakers is very poor, I would say that it's about the same as the internal speaker and my Mac Pro, only a little louder. These are cheap speakers, so I did not expect them to perform as well as my sound sticks, but I did expect better sound than the internal speaker in my computer.  The speakers are fairly small and portable so if you just need something for a laptop while you're on the road these might not be bad, but if you're expecting great sound quality you will be disappointed.	0

Got it about a week ago.It does exactly what I wanted to do, and a bit more besides. I really like being able to tune in the radio station from the Podfreq base instead of from my iPod. I have a digital radio in my car so it's very easy to match frequencies. It does not seem to pull much power from the iPod, and it does come with a car charger. It also comes with foam pads that enable you to custom fit your iPod to the Podfreq. The latch mechanism holds the iPod quite efficiently.There is also a very solid extendable antenna that works quite well. I have had very clear reception in the city. And if I hear any static over the radio I just extend the antenna and it goes away.Previously I had run the iPod through my car system by means of a tape. The sound is much better now, and I don't have to have that extra wire, so the iPod is much easier to use. And the excellent sound quality of the iPod comes out through using the Podfreq, as it never did with the tape.Haven't tried it out on the road yet, so I don't know how much of a pain it might be to change stations. I suspect not much, but I don't have experience of that.The whole thing seems quite well-built and designed. With respectful handling (it is, after all, mostly plastic) I think it will last quite awhile. The latch holds the iPod very well and the foam pads keep it from rattling. The buttons for power and changing the radio station are big enough to handle easily, and the display is large and easy to read, even for 50-year-old eyes. The antenna attachment on the back seems firm, and the antenna seems the same as you'd find on portable radios--in other words, not flimsy. The car charger is pretty compact and has a coiled cord which I prefer to a straight cord.I have two small concerns: the part that rotates out from the base so that you can stand the Podfreq up is plastic and looks delicate, so I don't think I'll be using it in the car. Also, I will be sticking some velcro on the back of the unit so that the whole thing doesn't slip off the car seat when I come to a stop. But that's easy to do.The Podfreq does the same thing inside my car as my other can't-do-without accessory, InMotion speakers, does inside my house. I'm very glad I got it, and it has resulted in my using my iPod much more in my car because it's easier to use and sounds a whole lot better.	1
For the size of these the sound quality is OK, just not a lot of it. Plugged them in and opened my iTunes and played the first one that caught my eye, Abracadabra by the Steve Miller Band. I figured that would be a good one to check them out with since it has a broad range of sound in it. The highs are fairly sharp while the bass comes through good, overall I was surprised with the performance for the size of them.There are a few things that could be improved though. First of all I was surprised to see that the speakers don't have any kind of cover over the front of them at all. I've never seen any speakers, especially of this size and that are supposed to be portable, with no protection over the speaker. The center of the speaker is very vulnerable on these and won't last very long unless you are very careful of how you use and handle them. Another thing with them is the amount of space they take. I don't know about other people and how they use their laptop computer but the small table that I use for mine has limited space and there just isn't room for them. There's one similar on Amazon, Lifetime Personal Folding Table 30"L x 20"W, but mine is only 28"L x 18"W and with my 17" Dell Studio laptop on it there's only enough room for a mouse pad beside it. I would suggest that they make some sort of clip on hanger on the back of them so they can be mounted on the top edge of the screen of a laptop like the external web cams are. That would get them up and out of the way. I'm going to see what I can make with some brass welding rod and a couple of small squeeze clamps. Then there are the wires. With the plugin for the speaker/headphone jack and the other for the USB plugin and the one connecting the two, that's a lot of extra wires to get tangled with all the others. But, there's no other way to do them, yet, and I do like the USB plug to power them. That beats the usual transformer block plugin that needs another space on your powerstrip that's probably already crowded enough. I have just noticed one other thing that could be changed. There is no way to disconnect the two speakers from each other. There's one wire about 30" long connecting the two together. Which makes it a bit awkward when taking them with your laptop while traveling. It would be a lot easier if you could unplug the one speaker and wrap all the wires together with the other one for transporting them.With my music playing over them as I write this although they don't have a lot of volume they have enough to sound pretty good close up. They do get a little rattly with some distortion when there's heavy bass which is what I expected because of their size. While they are not anything as good as Bose speakers are, for the price, I think they are a pretty good deal. If you want something for movies on on your laptop or music while you work on your laptop and your on a budget, I recommend these.Up Date 4-28-12Well, just what I was afraid of. First the left speaker started fading, then sound from both started to degrade. Now the left speaker doesn't produce anything above a faint whisper and the right sounds real bad, like a speaker with a hole it trying to play too much bass. I was afraid these little things wouldn't last very long and I was right. So save your money and put a little more with what you would spend on these and get some better ones.	0
Took along my Ipod & Podfreq to the U.K.  It's small enough to pack, the 12v cord takes no space and it serves in the car or any place (such as a canal narrowboat with 12 volt access) with a FM stereo.  The Ipod will also charge through the Podfreq while plugged into 12v.  A very nice option when you are out of the country and are hesitant to charge your Ipod through a converter.We were able to enjoy our own brand of music and audio books.	1
Talk about FALSE advertising. It states on the box for use with any 3.5 mm headphone jack device. Sure...IF you want to be tethered to a USB device since that is the only way these speakers are powered. The speakers are ok when being used with a laptop/netbook but besides that look elsewhere.	0

No... the "noise" isn't the music I play, it's the constant interference sound that emanates from these speakers on a continual basis.Sound quality is good and they look nice and stylish. But there are some drawbacks, which if addressed would admittedly make these speakers more expensive.  Chief among these is the relieance of thses speakers on power drawn frou a USB port.  That makes their use with an i-Pod extremely unlikey (contrary to the promotional information).  Secondly it would be nice if there was a volume control on the speakers proper.  There isn't, so if you need to adjust the volume, you'll have to do it via the Audio Controls at the end of your Windows Taskbar.Whic brings me around to the sound.  Interesingly enough, it does not increase or decrease with the volume control.  That suggests to me some kind of interference from my PC (although I did test them with another PC, and got the same situation.  That's a disappoinment.The Z110 speakers might be just what you're looking for if you're on a budget.  You may or may not have the same noise problem that I had, but if you don't want to spend a lot of money, perhaps your machine will play nicer with them than my HP EliteBook 8540p.  Good luck!	0
I have read many of the reviews, some great and others so-so.  But one thing that frustrates me is the lack of information on this product.  Somehow going to a store makes it easy to touch and feel what it has and what is needed.  I cannot find anything that talks about how this thing is powered let alone more detailed pictures and product descriptions/requirements.  For example, I have a Dodge Neon so how would I mount this thing let alone what powers it and my iPod.  I'm fairly new to the iPod products so my 3 stars is due to the lack of pre-purchase information provided by Amazon.  Sorry but I want to buy this thing today but it's hard to do so with answered questions.	1
Buying this off the shelf, I totally missed the fine print about "applicator spray" until the package was already open. Installation was wet, sticky and tedious (pushing out all the bubbles took half an hour), and at the end, my screen was a cloudy, bubbly mess. As advised, I left the tablet off overnight, and in the morning, the screen was clear, with only a few tiny bubbles. I was relatively happy with it, but after a month, one corner peeled up. I've now replaced it with the RealLook protector, which took exactly 3 minutes and looks beautiful.	0

This product does NOT adequately cover the keys. It does not align up with the keyboard properly, thus making it hard to type. Do not buy this product if you want to cover your keyboard.	0
Very nice product - except does NOT work with OS X 10.4 Tiger. Apple knows, manufacturer knows - we'll see if bugs are worked out. Until then, know it works great with Panther and previous OS.USB Overdrive seems to solve this problem!	1
The product arrived undamaged in a factory sealed cellophane sleeve.  However, the keyboard skin was longer than the sleeve and had been folded to fit.  The fold resulted in a permanent deformity that would not allow the skin to fit flat on the keyboard.  Even after sitting overnight on a flat surface the cover would not lay flat on the keyboard.BUT good ol' Amazon refunded my purchase price without a quibble!  I will continue to shop Amazon for the majority of my retail purchases.	0

This is a good power supply for the Dell laptops but that's all it is...a power supply.  This does not charge the battery.  When this is plugged in, it will power the laptop, but the Power Indicator will tell you you're on battery supply and react accordingly.  Also, the power supply I received is not grounded as is shown in the pictures.What this means is that your Windows 7 system will not perform its updates when it thinks it's on battery power.  I purchased this with a replacement battery.  The replacement battery had 45% when I first used it and that's what it has now almost 3 months later.  The seller was great to work with to remedy the situation, but I still have to get another power supply that will power up the system and charge the battery.  Good seller, however the product is not up to standards.	0
I love everything about this mouse, except the poor battery life.  It lasts maybe four weeks or normal use.  If they could only fix that problem, this would be the perfect mobile mouse.	1
I gave it a two star rating (didn't like it) because it does power up the Laptop, but it does not charge it... therefore i can't hate it.From what i read online after the fact is that Dell chargers have a third wire or a chip in the charger to detect it's a genuine charger.  I was replacing a broken charger for a customer and this new charger didn't charge the laptop therefore it's useless.	0

Keyboard:========The keys are hard to press - they obviously keep typing quiet by making the keys harder to press. This becomes irritating during long typing sessions or when using the number pad especially. The key presses aren't &#34;clean&#34;. The posture for your hands though is more comfortable than a traditional keyboard.Mouse:=======A decent reliable USB mouse. For the price, its a good mouse. I wish it had a bit more weight to it though.Overall I wouldn't recommend this. If you do a lot of typing for documents or programming, you'll easily get frustrated by the way the keys press down. For a few dollars more you can get better keyboard/mouse combos.	0
After a week of heavy usage, I am very satisfied with the m310. The mouse is very light and compact and is perfectly designed for travel. The wireless receiver fits inside the mouse when traveling. There is a spring-controlled door that covers the cavity where the receiver is stored so no dust can enter inside.The mouse tracks very well but I've noticed two small problems. First, the sensor goes into lower power if the mouse is not moved in 30 seconds. Afterwards, it takes around a second before a movement of the mouse will be registered. Also, the mouse turns itself off after 5 minutes which can sometimes be annoying as it takes a button click to turn it back on. The second problem is that the mouse doesn't track on my C4-NGEN mousing surface ([...] This is a solid copper-colored teflon surface designed for low-friction movement. All of my logitech mice work perfectly on this surface but the m310 will not (actually it works initially but will not "wake up" after the sensor goes into lower power so it's an issue of the mouse not detecting movement in the lower power mode). Other than these two issues, I've not had any further tracking problems.The m310 is an excellent value. Compared to the Logitech equivalent, the optical notebook mouse, which I also own, the m310 is lighter, more compact, and cheaper by $10. The only Microsoft mouse that is close to the m310 is corded, larger, heavier, and sells for the same price.In summary, the m310 is your best bet if you want a smaller sized mouse. It's a great product at an excellent price.At time time I'm writing this, Amazon does not show a picture for the mouse. The mouse is black with silver accents. See the BenQ website for accurate photos.	1
I don't know what it is about this keyboard... It works as advertised, although I hate having to use multiple usb ports (one for the mouse, and one for the keyboard) to use the device... I never seems to &#34;fit&#34; me right. I always... if I have a lot of writing to do, wind up disconnecting it and using the Microsoft Comfort Keyboard instead. It seems to have something to do with the fact that is  &#34;lays so low&#34; on the table I guess. I have large hands, and the &#34;thicker&#34; Microsoft Comfort Keyboard just seems to &#34;fit&#34; better. And for the same price too.	0

I usually love Pelican products, I have them for many things that I want to protect.  So, when I purchased my first iPad (newest generation) I turned to Pelican for a case to carry it.  Big disapointment.  This is simply a case, with the Pelican name, and very limited interior padding.  The space for the iPad does not fit its dimensions, so if you place the iPad alone in the case it flops around and is damaged.  If you have any kind of skin or sleeve, then the iPad will not fit in the Pelican case.  And, there is no separation between the iPad to the "wonderful" accessories tray that they so proudly tout.  Put it all in the case, seal it up, travel/walk for a day, and at the end you will end up with a mess and most likely a scratched "retina" screen.  Save your money and look somewhere else.  I was so sure of the Pelican quality that I simply threw away all the documentation needed to return the case - big mistake.  So I cannot return the item, and I cannot use the item for its intended purpose.  Maybe I can use it as some kind of expensive camera accessories case?  Very displeased.	0
I am very impressed with the BenQ M310.  I previously used the Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0, which was full sized, has a wired-dongle as large as the mouse itself and annoying for travel with a notebook.  Switching to the BENQ M310 provides many benefits:- Extremely compact for portability- Efficient size and functionality- Very responsive and accurate- Clever design- Standard button and scroll functions (no left/right scroll)- Auto offI have a large hand, so it took a bit of time to get used to the smaller base and not being able to rest my hand on the unit.  But I've gotten used to it with regular use.  I highly recommend it and would give as a gift.	1
2 stars since it would actually work to lock down a Kensington compatible device.But out of the packages, the outgassing of the plastic coating on the cable stinks.  I'm going to leave it in the garage for a while to see if it stops and becomes usable.  I wouldn't want this in my office in this condition.Lock seems super flimsy.  Inserting the key into the barrel and turning, you can still lever the key over and &#34;bend&#34; it back and forth in the lock.Next time (and possibly this time, depending on how the smell comes out) I'll pass and get the real thing (actual Kensington brand lock).  &#60;sweeping generalization&#62;I guess stuff from China isn't just cheap because of cheap labor, but cheap materials and processes, too. &#60;/sweeping generalization&#62;	0

I have used various wireless mice for use with my laptop as a secondary computer.  I seem to have problems with each one because my usb port is in the back on the right hand side of the laptop (Dell Inspiron) and the sensor doesn't always connect with the mouse on the left-hand side of the laptop for my use.  The BenQ M310 works great!  I love this mouse!  It is a great fit to my hand, is very portable, and comes with a little carrying pouch to toss into your laptop bag.  I haven't used it long enough to comment about the battery life, since I use my laptop during class to take notes (4x a week), to research, and when I travel.  I haven't had any trouble with the auto-off feature; it turns right back on quickly enough for me to not miss a beat during class, and it is small enough that it doesn't get in the way of anyone else's space at the conference table.  This is a great mouse, and I would recommend it to anyone.	1

This is strictly a casual deterrent sort of lock -- the cable is thin (maybe 2/8ths inch, tops), and could be severed by any halfway decent wire cutter.  Don't use this lock as your primary form of security.Worse, this lock does not work with newer iMacs (the one with the thin bezel) or the unibody MacBook Pros.  It does fit into the slot in a Thunderbolt display, and may work with other kinds of Macs, but I haven't tested.  If you have a Mac, I'd avoid this product and find one that is known to work with your computer.	0
To avoid burning a coaster, update the firm ware on your dual layer compatable drive first ([...]).

Verbatim has been a top tier physical media manufacturer for as long as I can remember. These discs are no exception. I use these to back up my Xbox 360 games and never have any issues with skipping or bad writes. I have gone through about 200 of these and have not experienced any disc related problems. Highly recommend if you need quality media.	1
This is a piece of junk and the seller is highly suspect as well. Take a look at all of the reviews preceding mine. The vast majority of them have never reviewed another item on Amazon. These are probably fake reviews written by or on behalf of the seller.The player itself freezes constantly when you try to use any of the modes during play. When you try to load a file (MPEG2 and AVI), you're lucky if it will read every other one. When it doesn't, it needs to be re-booted. Additionally, SDHC's formatted in NFTS may not work at all.Expect to see numerous accusations against my review as a result of the seller mustering his forces to discredit this legitimate review.	0

I bought this to play a "digital sign" at my booth at a show - just the thing, I thought. I already have a 1920x1080p monitor with an DVI input, so I bought an HDMI to DVI cable (electrically the same, but HDMI also has audio). Unfortunately it didn't work - the monitor sync light came on for all the HDMI output modes in the "Video Standard" cycle (NTSC, 480P, HDMI-720P, HDMI-1080I, HDMI-1080P), but I had no luck getting any display. I contacted Erik at KdLinks and he promptly responded that it doesn't work on 1080P monitors, only 1080P TVs!This is odd, because my computers can display on either the TV or the monitor, and the DVI standard for video is the same as HDMI, but without the audio.So unless someone can suggest a TV with a 100x100mm VESA mount, I think I'll just use my MAC laptop instead...	0

I purchased two keyboard covers for my new MBA.  One was green and only a dollar so I didn't have high hopes.  The other was this one.  I like the cheap, green one much better because it's much thinner and it fits better.  This clear one is quite thick and is just slightly big. Therefore typing on this one is not nearly as good as the green one.  I'll buy more of the cheap one and probably send this back	0
If you have a high-quality burner, these can safely be burned at speeds in excess of the conservatively-rated 2.4x.  They are reliable and affordable, and a great choice for making dual-layer DVD backups.	1
Wow, if you aren't proficient at taking things apart you want to skip doing this on your own. Anyhow, I replaced the battery and it would not charge. Tossed it as I had soldered it already and was not worth the trouble to get a replacement.	0

Soldering this on is a bit difficult.  After the third attempt it would power up but wouldn't work with this battery.  It could have been that I melted some contacts trying to attach it, or the battery itself.  I can't recommend you try to do the job and use this battery unless you have replaced these types before.	0

It is a high-risk to not hold the tablet at all-times when carrying the keyboard around, the tablet goes on top of the skinny black holder but it does NOT attach itself so you have to very careful when carrying it around. It looks very professional IMO, it would've been 5 stars if it wasn't a hassle to constantly worry about it falling apart from the keyboard. Another annoying thing is that you need to constantly enter some Bluetooth code into your tablet settings in order to use this keyboard.	0

The product came in on time, actually ahead of schedule. I opened the securely packed case. When I tried to fit the case together with my samsung galaxy tab 10.1 It slides out very easy. I'm very disappointed with this product and would like to send it back. Be careful buying this and listen to the other writers. Don't waste your time.	0
What i have to say it's simple BUY THEM! excellent quality and no problems at all! perfects to burn xbox 360 games :)	1
It does not fit galaxy 10.1.  It is smaller than the tablet.Maybe in galaxy tab 2. The description is wrong.	0

It did not fit and I especially looked around and they said it would fit the Galaxy NOTE 10.1 which it did NOT. Sent it back and it was fully refunded promptly. Thank you Amazon	0
Only burned one DVD at 2x and everything was fine.  Haven't tried another yet but I think it will be fine.	1
its cheaply made and doesn't hardly work. don't waste your money on this product go with a better name brand device.	0

USED ONCE, DONT EVEN KOW WHERE IT IS ANYMORE. SHOULDA SENT IT BACK BUT OH WELL. STUPID IDEA WASNT WORTH IT. MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.	0
Excellent product. I had absolutely no problems using these double layer DVDs. All I can say about this product is excellency.	1
We sent this keyboard back within a week of using it. It is NOT an actual case/ cover as it advertises. It doesn't stay on the Galaxy to be useful as a cover. It's basically just a keyboard. The tablet sits in it, but the rubber stops to help this press into the glass and leaves marks on the screen. It also didn't seem to be well put together. The keys stuck a lot beneath the silver casing because the casing was loose around the keypad. Really not a good buy if you want a real cover/case with keyboard. If you just want a keyboard then you can get away with this.	0

It over heats and after 3 days it started to break apart so maybe I got a bad one or they are just like that	0
Verbatim has been reliable DVDs to burn on. This is my second buy and I will probably buy them again.	1
I gave this keyboard 2 stars because it does only half of what I want. I wanted a good reliable keyboard that I could type on with decent speed. This has that part covered, I really like the keys and the way they feel.Pro's - the keys feel good and the tablet doesnt flip backward you dont have to pair everytime you cut on the tablet and keyboard.Cons - this thing is slippery you will have to put something under it to keep it from sliding around. The biggest problem for me though is that I thought that you could flip your Galaxy Tab over and snap it into the keboard cover, you cant! It looks like you can but no, so I have to decide over the next few days if I will send it back or not.If you havent bought this keyboard yet I say DO NOT BUY! part of my purchase decision was based on using this to help protect the screen while I traveled between home-work-and school and thats only gonna happen if I use duck tape!	0

For around a year this worked pretty well. Then the lanyard came out of the leather piece where it is joined to the thinner lanyward which threads through the camera. Not good. One might be forgiven for assuming that the sewing goes through the lanyards, but it does not. All that is holding the whole thing together is some glue, apparently not very good glue. We were lucky that it failed when the camera would not be damaged.So buy something that's properly made, not this.	0
The "go to" brand. Always reliable and decent prices available. I avoid other brands, even at deep discounts.Can not go wrong with these, ever.	1
The strap looks and works exactly as described.  I have it on an Olympus OMD EM-5.  I wouldn't work as well on a large DSLR but wouldn't be bad either.EDIT:  IT BROKE!!!  This was a great strap for 10 months, then it broke dropping my EM-5 onto a wooden deck.  Luckily the camera didn't brake, which it certainly would have if it fell on concrete.  Down to 2 stars.	0

I bought this strap for my mirrorless camera, a Panasonic GX7 with the 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens... one of the lightest setups on a mirrorless system.Today, I used the wrist strap (which I rarely use), it snapped and my GX1 went flying to the concrete.... at least I wasn't using my Leica lens... thanks Cosmos!Well, it's not that it "snapped" per se, that poor excuse for an adhesive couldn't hold it together and the string pulled apart from the leather.This $9 strap just cost me a bunch of money... but oh well, at least it gives me an excuse to buy the GX7!	0
Wish the media wasn't so spendy but I needed to to make some backups of my software.  Worked great!  Highly recommended.	1
Poor quality. Glue came lose after too long. I'm glad I noticed it because my camera would have fallen off had I not.	0

I Have. Tried several different chargers for my kindle fire HD 8'9'.This is the worse one ever lasted only one week then got hot and stopped working only 20 mins after being plugged in to charge my kindle..please do not waste your money,Geeeeeee I wish they would make a good replacement charger for my kindle!!1	0
I bought this item after reading lot of reviews stating that these MAde IN Singapore Dual layer DVD from Verbatim are the best. I have had a few failures though. However, I suspect that my burner has gone bad. I used a different burner, and it burned perfectly. I will replace my dvd burner, and am hoping that I wont get any coasters.	1

Save your money and splurge 19.99 or less on The Amazon Speed Charger. This charger took hours and hours to charge and never charged completely. Most likely will throw away since it will cost more to return.	0
This renamed brand brings and excellent media storage product, working with the perfect write speed and compatible with any DVD Burner.The price has a considerable discount in comparison with the Verbatim store.Don't miss the opportunity to get this excellent media for a considerable price.	1
You plug this device in and think your kindle is charging when in fact the cord has not made good contact.  As a result, you pick up your Kindle thinking it is fully charging only to find out it has not charged at all.  Also, cord is very short.  I would not recommend to a friend.	0

Verbatims give the best quality burn over any other burnable media.Sometimes, a few disks in the pack are not the best, but a few bad burns is better than all bad burns with a lower quality and cheaper brand. I will continue to buy these whenever I need blank media.	1
I purchased this charger hoping it would work for our kindle. The power light would come on the charger but it would not even charge the kindle at all. I even left it plugged in for a couple of hours and the charging light on the kindle wouldn't even turn on. My phone charger is also compatible with the kindle fire and it wouldn't charge my phone either. I had to purchase a phone charger to get my kindle to turn on again.	0

I have burned 4 dvd's with this product. All but one was perfect and error free. I one coaster created was done at my own fault. Good price if you don't need a gaggle of dvd's to burn. Good for a lot of video or a really bunch of data	1
This was one of the few chargers that can properly charge a Kindle Fire, as well as other devices like cell phones.  It did work great, but it just died on us yesterday after about 2.5 months of use.  It now won't charge anything at all (even though the little red light is on), and it's too late to return it.	0

If your going to burn, these are a must, especially XGD3 stuff	1
I would not recommend this company. I ordered this keyboard for a repair on a clients netbook.  When the client brought in his netbook so I could repair it I then noticed the keyboard edge by the ctrl and shift key metal back was bent. I tried to repair it but it was impossible. Now I see I can not return this for a replacement as I went slightly over the return date.  I never knew Amazon had a NON return date set up on products.  Buyer beware.	0

These DVDs have the best compatibility that I've come across. I haven't found a DVD player that won't read video burned on these.	1
I can see that most customers are happy with the product. That was not my experience.  I knew what I was buying - tablet for temporary notes, which you cannot save, but you can leave a note for somebody at home, which can be easily erased and does not waste paper. I was using is probably one or twice in a week, and it stopped working (stopped erasing) in 3 months, probably literally after 15-20 uses. Considering that erasing is the only time you need a battery, I assume that battery died, and battery cannot be replaced (it's soldiered in, and if you try to remove it, you need pretty sharp knife, and the result probably will be ruined tablet anyway). As I'm looking at it, battery could be very easily made replaceable. I liked it while it lasted (though I cannot say I really needed it or that it was very useful), but that was very short-lived.	0

I've tried several different reusable writing surfaces, and this is probably the worst. As other reviewers note, you can't replace the battery, sure, and the coloring could be a lot more vivid given this is an electronic thing. But I'll also add that if you keep the side of your hand on the writing surface *at all* when you write (which most/many adults making Western characters will do), ghost marks will show up under what you've written on this thing... and of course you can't erase them without erasing the entire surface at once. The product description says the surface is pressure-sensitive, but 1) I don't find a great deal of variation in my pen stroke widths on this device, and 2) it seems a bit *too* sensitive, given my remark above about how easy it is to smudge an otherwise clean surface below the drawing/writing.You might as well get one of those underwater writing tablets if you're looking for something that can be wiped very clean, but that can also hold up to a bit of rough handling -- or simply a white board (they have dry erase markers that are wax-based) ... or heck! even a chalk board. (I know! Novel, right?)I'll say the same thing with trying to draw on my Kindle with Sketchbook Pro (albeit convenient): there are some things that tech really can't touch. ... But in this case specifically, it's that you can't really touch the tech.	0
Even though it's labeled 2.4x, my 16x burner burns these at 8x which is much better than the 50 min burn process on the 2.4x ones.  I bought the memorex brand after buying the Verbatim's because the memorex offered 5 extra discs at $7 less.  That was a big mistake since more than half the memorex 2.4x ones were all not burning correctly.  I think 2.4x is just too slow for such a large disc and it's a miracle if you can get just one to work right without stressing out your dvd player lazer.  These Verbatims not only burn at 8x, but they read so nicely in my dvd player. I cannot even hear the lazer and doesn't sound like major wear and tear when trying to read Verbatims, the way the memorex's do.  Stay away! from Memorex 2.4x 8.5GB discs or any brand of 8.5GB discs that only lets you burn at 2.4x.  That speed is just so ridiculous.  I didn't buy a 16X burner to burn at 2.4x and it seems 2.4x's are the only ones available, except for these secret 8x Verbatims.	1
I'm not sure what I was expecting but this was disappointing.  The writing was not white enough to really see.	0

We had a Model WT10340 on our boat.  The boat is large and dry and the Boogie Board was on the wall in the galley. After less than a year of very infrequent use, the Boogie Board died. No writing appears on the screen and the erase button does nothing.  I presume that either the battery or the circuitry has failed.	0

I love gadgets and after seeing this one decided to give it a try. It's made well but the problem I had when you write on it with the stylus it seems a little fuzzy also it's very dark, it has a greenish tint, I returned it not for me.	0
Looking around, Verbatim seems to have the reputation of having the best dual layer DVDs. I dont see any reason why they wouldnt. Purchased these. And they worked well. Not overly expensive.	1

Absolutely no "Coasters", using for making Xbox 360 backups of my originals. Get these they are from singapore, the other ones for faster rate suck, their made in India. I thought these were lightscribe capable, but of course I bought these at like 4 AM and wasn't seeing things clearly. All in all great discs, don't use them for anything but game backups so if your into that sorta thing get these, GREAT deal, get the 50, I got the twenty but now regret it, next time I will be sure to get the 50 when I run out.	1
I was jealous of my friend's rotating iPad stand and jumped on this when I saw it. I liked the color and thought the design was cool. It does what it says but not very well; maybe it's just the one that was sent to me. It doesn't seat well into the grooves and easily tips over. Nice concept, not very sturdy. I don't want to trust a $500 device to it.	0

The product sold be eTech is definitely NOT what is pictured here - BE WARNED!While eTech's product does sufficiently hold a standard SD card, it is smaller, thinner and feels like a cheaper product. Also, it does NOT look like what is pictured here.	0
They are pretty cheap CDs but they are useful and they do the trick. They arrived on time and not much to complain about. That's about it.	1
The picture shows durable quality hard plastic clear cases. What you get are flimsy cheap bendable blue tinted plastic cases instead. The cases are flimsy and the smallest amount of pressure will cause the case to fold making the sides to slide and latch to open. The cases feel like they're going to crack at the seams and fall apart after a couple days of use. The card won't stay put so if you put the cases in your pocket expect your memory cards to fall out and get scratched by your keys or phone. These cases are not what other people are selling on Amazon for roughly the same price. Frankly you'd have more protection with a ziplock bag. You're better off getting 3 or 4 cases that are good quality for the same price.The cards may be &#34;Fulfilled by Amazon&#34; but you have to contact customer service to get a refund instead of selecting it from your account and selecting &#34;not as advertised&#34; making it a hassle. You can either click the sellers name, select contact seller, order I placed, under the 2nd option select contact amazon and chat to get a refund or call amazon at 1-866-216-1072.	0

What is shown in the picture is what you most likely will not get. The cases in the picture are quite nice cases. I have one that came with an SD card awhile ago but what came in the mail today were thinner cases that were meant to hold MicroSD combo packs which are arguably more likely to be used today. They work, but sadly they are not as fancy to open or as nice as the ones in the picture.	0
Finally, I got it. This will help me to download files. I really needed these DVDs. 8.5 GB FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks guys!!	1
Excellent, prompt shipping from vendor.  After using smaller, more durable cases that come with my SD cards, these are pretty flimsy, and larger than they need to be.  The little clip that keeps them closed works well, and is what helps in keeping them as backup cases.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't trust them to adequately protect the cards. For the cost, they're worth trying.	0

These cases are very large for their intended purpose.  If you look at the web page it does give the dimensions of  2-1/16&#34; x 1-11/16&#34; x 5/16&#34;.  While it fits regular SD cards well the micro SDHC do not fit and just rattles around inside.The plastic is thin and offers little protection.  The case does not positively shut and lock.  Even folding down the locking tabs, if you press the center of the case it will unlock.  If you squeeze the edges of the case it will unlock and open.  If you push down on the center of the case it will contact your card.  This case will not adequately keep dust out.Add all of these detractions with the large size and you'll understand there are better options out there.	0
I burned a map update for my car GPS using a Mac and disk utility on normal speed and it burned a 8 Gig file in like 20 minutes. I read on many forums to use the Verbatim brand for this and they didn't let me down.	1
Product I received doesn't match the picture included in the listing.  These cases are VERY thin and cheaply made...provide no resistance to pressure and flex horribly. These are NOT like the cases that used to come with memory cards at all.	0

Oversized for what it is holding, much larger than an SD card and very very flimsy plastic. Not very good quality.	0
Generally, no complaints.  Out of about 20 burns only 2 or 3 had errors that could potentially be tied to the DVDs themselves.  Admittedly, the disc covers are pretty plain and uninteresting.  You can certainly find DVD DLs cheaper, though Verbatim's quality seems to be higher.	1
The majority of the ten will not latch closed.  They are very cheaply made and take forever and a day to arrive.  Don't bother.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	0

These are much thinner than similar cases, and the slot for the SD card is a tad too large, so the card can slide about.	0
These are my top choice as they are dependable. A little more pricey, but it pays for itself in successful burns and lessened stress!	1
I tried all of them and this set was supposed to be for my Canon SX50 HS and I put the ring that was supposed to be for it to hold my expensive lens and it dropped out nearly busted my lens and I contacted them for return and they told me I would have to pay for the return so I would not be shopping with them I might be selling these to someone that can actually use them don't believe everything that is posted on this site its not always true ask the camera company first.	0

I have to elaborate on this purchase.(this is really gonna p.o. the yamaha engineers...let's see how it unfolds)It's an ok system.  I've had Yamaha receivers and this setup is OK if you are a beginner or have little experience with AV systems.The reason that I returned this system is that I could buy a decent receiver and 5.1 speaker system, both better products than what is included in this Yamaha 5.1 cheap feeling package.  (energy 5.1 speaker system and a Yamaha, Pioneer, Denon, Marantz, Onkyo or Sony receiver and the list goes on)Personally, after reading so many, many reviews I really got some great gear after considering how long I'll have the system (looking at 10 years) and one that I can always build upon.  Again- this is much higher in cost, but I think I"m worth every penny and so are my ears! After reading so many freaking reviews on so many products...going to listen to gear, etc., I decided to buy something to allow me the ability to connect to a network, it's more $, but just offers so much more (the tech specs I will not bore you with)Bottom line- if you want an easy plug/play system and don't know/care too much about technology, this is for you- otherwise, do some research and avoid the all in one box solutions.	0
I am burning these discs on a Lite-On LH-20A1S and a Sony DRU-810A, and they work flawlessly.  Maybe it's the fact that they are on Sony's compatible list for the drive or that they are quality discs, I don't know.  But what I do know is that the picture quality that I got from my copy was PERFECT.  NO PIXELATION, NO DROPPED FRAMES, and NO PAUSES.  A perfect burn.I ran the Verbatim discs through DVDInfo Pro and it came back with write speeds of 2.4, 4.0, and 8.0 (see picture.)  The box mine came in says "up to 6x speed," so you MIGHT be able to push it to 8x with a high speed drive.For everyday, general consumer use you should find that these discs will give you a high quality, dependable burn.  Some may ask if they are archival quality, and I have to say that my guess is 'no.'  Unless the disc specifically says "archival quality" then I would assume that they are standard discs (which have been found to deteriorate over time.I highly recommend these discs for your approved DVD+R DL burner.  (Remember to check the media compatibility of your drive BEFORE you purchase these discs or any other disc!  See your drive manufacturer's website for details.)	1

I tad slow, but we expect instant gratification.Crappy packaging.Product is working just fine, (no coasters).Happy camper.	1
I hate wasting money. This monitor never worked. I bought this monitor since December and finally got the time to set it up. I opened the box for the first time and installed it. It never worked. I was so surprised that i tried to connect it to two other power sources. I am sooooooo disappointed. I guess that's what I get for buying cheap.	0

Overall I've had better success with Verbatim than any other brand of dual-layer DVD I've tried. I've experienced occasional problems with some copies "freezing" either momentarily or repeatedly upon playback, but I'm not sure if this problem had anything to do with the media used as opposed to the burner/software. By and large, though, Verbatims work well.	1
Display itself is ok, features are fine, nothing special.  However, I got mine with some dead pixels.  What can you expect with it being so cheap?  Its not bad, but it is noticeable.	0

Purchased these as back up batteries to the one provided with the camera - these do not hold charge too well. They are drained almost as soon as they are used. I would not recommend this at all.	0
These are the best discs for backups.  Do not buy Memorex or some off-brand, these are the way to go.	1
It's a shame the description on the batteries doesn't say how long they are supposed to last. I had high hopes after getting the batteries, but was disappointed with the results. I have measured the run time of both batteries and consistently get 27 minutes for one battery and 50 minutes for the second battery. While the price is certainly a bargain, they don't last as long as I had hoped. I have also bought a 2nd brand - Wasabi Power and they did much better. Their batteries lasted an average 95 minutes. I would definitely recommend them over this brand. The price is about the same.	0

I'm sorry but this product must be explained, the batteries  in the camera  only works for exactly 6 minutes even after a full charge, this product it's terrible, I'm really sorry, but i have to say it, I've been working for long time with video and this battery replacement are ver bad,I understand that the real canon batteries are very expensive, but I think now that original batteries are my only one option, I don't trust in any other not original stuff for canon cameras.	0
I've burnt 20 Verbatim, double layer, AZO discs with Imgburn program. Only 1 or 2 discs failed to burn successfully. That's an excellent rate of reliability compared to other brands or even to Verbatim's cheaper DVD products. I found only Verbatim discs with AZO technology are so reliable. They're a little more expensive but they're worth every penny. In fact, they're still affordable because they cost 1 dollar per disc.I've stopped using TDK double layer DVDs because they fail 40% of the time. I believe that's one of the reasons why all my local Costco stores stopped selling them last year. Now, they only sell TDK single layer.In short, this is One of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN  GET in terms of RELIABILITY and AFFORDABILITY.One year from now, I'll check and report their longevity. I mean I will find if my data recorded on them is still readable.P.S. IMPORTANT NOTEWe've found out a much cheaper and reliable way to archive data. That is save it to Blue-ray discs. A single layer blue-ray disc costs about $1.20 or less but it can hold three times more than a double layer DVD. Phillip discs has about 2% burning failure rate. So, they're very reliable. Blue-ray burners are also affordable these days.	1
I've had mine for a year now and use it mainly with a thumb drive that keeps all of my files and information.  There is plenty of memory left on the hard drive.  After a day of use, however,  I usually have to shut it down or it is lagging terribly.  I use it mainly for surfing the internet and Word documents, so nothing that should make a computer lag to this extent.	0

Amazon really needs to pull this item. Here are the stated dimensions:Dimension:11" x 8.75" L x WHere are the actual dimensions:4" x 3.5"This is just ridiculous. Just stop selling this already.	0
Did my homework compared products, reviews, customer reviews. Wanted the best, and got the best. Would recommend it to anyone.	1
Impossible PC connectivity. Spent much of the day trying to connect this device to my homework network to play music but after 7 hrs and useless Denon support I came to the conclusion that Denon put out a wonderful sound system without making sure their technical people had fully tested a clients' smooth installation.	0

I bought this monitor because after weeks of looking and shopping around I finally decided on the Asus PA248Q. Now, I know what you're saying, this isn't that. True. Honestly, the reason I got the PB248Q is because the PA inexplicably jumped in price from 320 dollars to $450 in a five day span. After trying for days to find out the differences between the two I couldn't come up with anything solid that translated to $200 in my head, so I got it. From what I understand difference #1 comes in the form of a color test prior to shipping. I conducted a test myself and found my screen to be well within the acceptable range of color out of the box, and this is something you should do on occasion, so I'm not sure if that's worth the price difference. Difference #2 is an inch.I could honestly do without the speakers. They are tinny and muddled. They don't put out a lot, despite the sound system being called HD it really isn't. I would much rather Asus made a PC248Q that was $50 cheaper and had no speakers. Despite the speaker quality I am not removing any points for that because a. I never expect much from monitor speakers, and b. I couldn't care less about them. If you're buying a monitor and speakers are going to sway your opinion get whatever one you want because odds are you're not worried about the quality of your picture too much.The picture! Here's the fun part. It's gorgeous. 80 mil:1 contrast ratio at this price sweetens the deal a great bit.What I've used it for so far,Gaming (farcry 3 and Assassin's Creed 3)Watching movies in 1080pediting photosediting videosI ramped up the visual quality on the games to see if I could catch anything but this screen took it like a champ. Everything looked beautiful. Photo editing was great. My photos have never looked this gorgeous. I actually had to go back and re-edit some of my old stuff because of how good this monitor made my bad. Like I said, out of the box everything was spot on. The grid I thought I'd never use because what editing software doesn't have that feature? But it's so easy to just turn on with the click of a button on the monitor. So I will be using the feature a lot I imagine.The build: This monitor's base is a tank. The whole thing is really nice, and it feels like it could survive an A bomb. When I took it out of the box to set it up as I turned around I bumped into the corner of the monitor. IT GAVE ME A DEADARM! Seriously! I was amazed. The thing barely wobbled and took me out of commission for a minute or two, lol. Turning the monitor felt reliable and sturdy at any height. It made sharing my computer really easy. I love the ruler'ed edges. It's a nice touch. Turning the monitor 90 degrees was one smooth fluid motion. My one complaint about the build is the button placement. When I go to raise or lower the screen I tend to grab it from the sides. I also tend to hit the buttons on the side when I do this. Putting the buttons on the bottom or top of the monitor seems like a better option to me, but eventually, even the top becomes the side. I'm not thrilled with the navigation of the menu options, but that's more or less because I'm not used to them. So this can result in fumbling with the buttons until things go away. Especially in the dark.Addressing complaints on this monitor/Light Bleed: I see none. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about honestly. At it's brightest I saw no bleed.too bright: It was very easy to swap to theater mode, which greatly dampened the brightness. It was also very easy to just adjust the brightness settings. Out of the box it seemed bright, but my eyes adjusted quickly and it wasn't an issue for me.Packaging:The monitor came with anything you would want to use to connect except HDMI. It came set up on the stand well protected. I was worried because this is the first time I have bought a monitor online. But the foam it comes cased in is strong. A ups driver would've had to have a rough day to damage this thing. There was a film on the screen. Polish maybe? I used a soft cloth to wipe it off and it was fine.(the comp I used to base this review on is comprised of, Intel Core I7, EVGA 660, Gigabyte z77x motherboard)So, here's the bad part. The second or third day I had this monitor it made a high pitched squeal when it was turned on. It only happened after it was off for an extended period of time. If I turned the monitor on and off it would go away. But after the first time it happened almost every day. So I got a replacement from Amazon, and it did the same thing. I posted a question about it here, and followed the steps to see if it would work. None of them did. It wasn't my computer, it wasn't anything else in my apartment. From what I understand it was a capacitor loading up. A power supply issue. (Not my first Asus product with power supply issues). I contacted Asus customer service and they were a joke. The only two answers given me were send it in for repair (not happening with a brand new monitor thanks) or return it to Amazon. I contacted Amazon, told them what was going on, asked for a third replacement and they told me no. They then stopped carrying the product (although it is available thru other sellers it is no longer an Amazon certified purchase), and the informed me they would no longer carry the monitor until an investigation was done. Since another PB would likely be defective they opted not to replace it. I almost considered keeping it and dealing with the buzz but not at $250. I tried to post a video of the defect on Amazon but the file size was too big.So here I sit. It was an awesome monitor if Asus could get their act together and not cheap out on the power supply. I'm highly disappointed.	0
These DVDs were the lowest price online and are the only dual layer discs that work great in my finicky LG DVD Recorder. I have the LG DR787T, and if you're like me, or others, you'll probably fine that its one of the most problematic recorders ever made! I still have it, because its seems to be one of the only DVD recorders to record to DVD dual layer and Verbatim 2.4% is the only brand it will accept with little or no error. Beside Maxell, these are the only other recommended brand. They record well.These discs work on ANY recorder that accepts DVD+R DL recordable / playable media. I just mentioned my LG because if it can work in that picky machine, it can work in anything! I use a computer to burn DVDs too, but a standalone recorder usually gets me more hours of recording time (in my case, 11HRs on one disc!)I film weddings and receptions for a living so, I like to fit a lot of video on a disc without having to sacrifice quality. For example, if I have a 4 Hour video compilation, I don't have to put my recorder on LP 4HR. I can put it on SP (2HR great quality) and still get the quality of LP. These are the discs usually used in commercial films you buy from stores.There isn't anything I dislike with the product.I'd recommend these discs to video media professionals like me who are not yet ready to make the move to Blu-Ray but still want a high capacity disc, without sacrificing quality. DVDs are all but dead, especially as these SD discs can be unconverted to 1080p resolution on an HD TV.	1
After reading all the reviews, I certainly thought this would be a great purchase.  After 6 months the monitor has completely died on me, and won't turn on.  I've kept it clean and kept good care of it (never moved it) and it still died.  Hopefully Asus will be able to fix it or replace it under warranty.	0

This is an awesome product, until it fails. Mine worked for about 1 month and then it started changing screen modes on it's own, I was able to get that to stop, and two days ago it started doing the same with the quick fit option, so now I have an useless monitor, that I can't sent for repair because I don't live in the US and I can't get a refund either.Don't buy this, just go for a better brand.	0
Not sure if 2.4x-6x means that depending on what speed I get or does it mean I can write either speed in between 2.4x and 6x. I tried to write 4x and it failed. Vendor need to state clearly what's the exact speed can be written.	1
I had this unit for two days and lost the WIFI signal on the second day. I disconnected the unit, restarted the router to no avail. I then read a review here that someone had the same problem. Bose told him that he needed to reload the system i.e. plug it into the computer and start all over again. Apparently his results have been marginal. I'm not reloading this thing for $350. It went back this morning!	0

Save your money and buy a quality Intel Core series, I3, I5 or I7, this works fine, but you get much more.	0
Just like the title says, no more coasters for this guy. Got tired of it and decided to spend the extra money for these bad boys.. problem solved.	1
After just one day, the touchscreen function stopped working.  Two phone calls and a live chat with Samsun and my computer expert yielded no solution.  Samsung wanted to pick it up and ship it to Texas (!) for 3 or 4 weeks for repair.  I said nuts to that and contacted Amazon, who willingly agreed to refund my money even though the product had been unpacked and used briefly.  As a result, I returned this and purchased its replacement, an HP Envy, from Amazon.  I have been a fan of Amazon for several years, and their return policy is one of the reasons I keep coming back.  I know if the product isn't what it should be, Amazon will make good on it.	0

This system is delivered with windows 8, also known as the new Vista. In case you try updating to the slightly better version windows 8.1 the system fails to update. There is an error code 0xc1900101-0x30018 which is discussed all over the web but no solution is apparent. The search on the Samsung Support website does not even show the error code.Samsung tech support enlightened me that they are only supporting this unit on windows 8 and not windows 8.1. Pretty poor statement as we just took this unit out of the box.A system which cannot be updated is basically useless within the shortest of time.Stay away from this one.	0
Their is no question that verbatim Disc are the BEST disc for any kind of recording but far superior for high end application like back up bluray movies and 360 games! Dont ever sell your equipment short and put in media that is bad for you laser and has a low reliability rate! I have burned about 4 or 500 of these exact 2.4x dual layer discs and only got 1 single coaster and they have ran like a dream in everything I play them on! Dont settle for less go Verbatim.	1
very poor quality&#8230; as I try to wipe the excess fluid off and it just ripped. I put on the second piece, wiped very gently, check it the next morning, the edge has shriveled. It dried and curl up at the edge!!	0

Will play off a USB loaded with photos, but barely has enough internal storage for one photo of decent size. controls dont work. read the reviews and thought I would take a chance.  I should've listened. I will be returning.	0
